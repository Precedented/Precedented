If she or he shall fail to do so or shall make a false designation, she or he shall be liable to anyone suffering a loss in consequence for the amount of the loss.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When a payment for materials is made to a subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman, the subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman shall demand of the person making the payment a designation of the account and the items of account to which the payment is to apply. In any case in which a lien is claimed for materials furnished by a subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman, it is a defense to the claim, to the extent of the payment made, to prove that a payment made by the owner to the contractor for the materials has been paid over to the subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman, and to prove also that when such payment was received by such subcontractor, sub-subcontractor, or materialman she or he did not demand a designation of the account and of the items of account to which the payment was to be applied or, receiving a designation of its application to the account for the materials, she or he failed to apply the payment in accordance therewith. This subsection is cumulative to any other defenses available to the person paying the materialman, subcontractor, or sub-subcontractor.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 63-135; s. 35, ch. 67-254; s. 7, ch. 77-353; s. 9, ch. 90-109; s. 808, ch. 97-102.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 84.141.</Text></Note></Section>
