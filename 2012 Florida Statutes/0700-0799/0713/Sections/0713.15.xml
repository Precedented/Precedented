This right to repossess and remove or replevy the materials shall not be affected by their sale, encumbrance, attachment, or transfer from the site of improvement, except that if the materials have been so transferred, the right to repossess or replevy them shall not be effective as against a purchaser or encumbrancer thereof in good faith whose interest therein is acquired after such transfer from the site of the improvement or as against a creditor attaching after such transfer. The right of repossession and removal given by this section shall extend only to materials whose purchase price does not exceed the amount remaining due to the person repossessing but where materials have been partly paid for, the person delivering them may repossess them as allowed in this section on refunding the part of the purchase price which has been paid.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 63-135; s. 35, ch. 67-254; s. 809, ch. 97-102.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 84.151.</Text></Note></Section>
