Upon the nonpayment of such sums in accordance with the rules of such park, or for failure to observe any provision of this part or the rules and regulations prescribed by the Department of Health, the owner, operator, or keeper thereof may instantly eject such occupant therefrom. A lien created in favor of an owner or operator of a mobile home park or recreational vehicle park may be enforced in the same manner as is now or may hereafter be provided by law for the enforcement of liens in favor of keepers of hotels and boardinghouses. Nothing in this section, however, shall prevent an owner or operator of a mobile home park or recreational vehicle park from enforcing any claim for rent under and in the manner provided by landlord and tenant acts of this state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 12419, 1927; s. 1, ch. 19365, 1939; CGL 4149; s. 36, ch. 67-254; s. 13, ch. 83-321; s. 277, ch. 99-8.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 85.28.</Text></Note></Section>
