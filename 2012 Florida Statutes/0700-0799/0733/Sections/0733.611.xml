<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0733.611" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Persons dealing with the personal representative; protection.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except as provided in s. 733.613(1), a person who in good faith either assists or deals for value with a personal representative is protected as if the personal representative acted properly. The fact that a person knowingly deals with the personal representative does not require the person to inquire into the authority of the personal representative. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to the personal representative. This protection extends to instances in which a procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is alive. This protection is in addition to any protection afforded by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 74-106; s. 78, ch. 75-220; s. 30, ch. 77-87; s. 1, ch. 77-174; s. 1008, ch. 97-102; s. 134, ch. 2001-226.</History></Section>
