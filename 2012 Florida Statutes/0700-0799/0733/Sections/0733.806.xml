The property advanced shall be valued at the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or at the time of the death of the decedent, whichever first occurs. If the recipient of the property does not survive the decedent, the property shall not be taken into account in computing the intestate share to be received by the recipient’s descendants unless the declaration or acknowledgment provides otherwise.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 74-106; s. 1021, ch. 97-102; s. 157, ch. 2001-226.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Created from former s. 734.07.</Text></Note></Section>
