However, a registered career offender who has been lawfully released from confinement, supervision, or sanction, whichever is later, for at least 20 years and has not been arrested for any felony or misdemeanor offense since release may petition the criminal division of the circuit court of the circuit in which the registered career offender resides for the purpose of removing the requirement for registration as a career offender. The court may grant or deny such relief if the registered career offender demonstrates to the court that he or she has not been arrested for any crime since release and the court is otherwise satisfied that the registered career offender is not a current or potential threat to public safety. The state attorney in the circuit in which the petition is filed must be given notice of the petition at least 3 weeks before the hearing on the matter. The state attorney may present evidence in opposition to the requested relief or may otherwise demonstrate the reasons why the petition should be denied. If the court denies the petition, the court may set a future date at which the registered career offender may again petition the court for relief, subject to the standards for relief provided in this paragraph. The department shall remove a person from classification as a career offender for purposes of registration if the person provides to the department a certified copy of the court’s written findings or order that indicates that the person is no longer required to comply with the requirements for registration as a career offender.</Text>
