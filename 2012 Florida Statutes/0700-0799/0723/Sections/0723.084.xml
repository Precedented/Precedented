However, storage charges, as provided in this section, may be collected by the real property owner from the lienholder and the assignee of such lienholder by an action at law as authorized by this act. The term “lienholder” as used in this act applies only to the lienholder for unpaid purchase price or first lien who has recorded said lien on the title of the mobile home.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The real property owner shall be entitled to collect storage charges accruing from 5 days after the lienholder receives written notice of either an eviction proceeding instituted by the real property owner against the homeowner, or that the mobile home is abandoned or voluntarily surrendered by the homeowner.
