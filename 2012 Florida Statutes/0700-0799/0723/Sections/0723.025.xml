Such consent may be revoked in writing by the mobile home owner at any time. The park owner has, however, the right of entry onto the lot for purposes of repair and replacement of utilities and protection of the mobile home park at all reasonable times, but not in such manner or at such time as to interfere unreasonably with the mobile home owner’s quiet enjoyment of the lot.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 84-80.</History></Section>
