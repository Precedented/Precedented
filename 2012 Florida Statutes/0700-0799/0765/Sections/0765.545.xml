<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0765.545" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Physician supervision of cadaveric organ and tissue procurement coordinators.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Procurement organizations may employ coordinators who are registered nurses, physician’s assistants, or other medically trained personnel who meet the relevant standards for procurement organizations adopted by the agency under s. 765.541, to assist in the medical management of organ donors or in the surgical procurement of cadaveric organs, tissues, or eyes for transplantation or research. A coordinator who assists in the medical management of organ donors or in the surgical procurement of cadaveric organs, tissues, or eyes for transplantation or research must do so under the direction and supervision of a physician medical director pursuant to rules and guidelines adopted by the agency. With the exception of organ procurement surgery, this supervision may be indirect supervision. For purposes of this section, the term “indirect supervision” means that the medical director is responsible for the medical actions of the coordinator, that the coordinator is operating under protocols expressly approved by the medical director, and that the medical director or his or her physician designee is always available, in person or by telephone, to provide medical direction, consultation, and advice in cases of organ, tissue, and eye donation and procurement. Although indirect supervision is authorized under this section, direct physician supervision is to be encouraged when appropriate.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 91-271; s. 9, ch. 94-305; s. 1035, ch. 95-148; s. 34, ch. 2003-1; s. 17, ch. 2009-218.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 381.6025.</Text></Note></Section>
