For purposes of part satisfaction, property given during the testator’s lifetime is valued at the time the devisee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or at the time of the death of the testator, whichever occurs first.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 74-106; s. 38, ch. 75-220.</History></Section>
