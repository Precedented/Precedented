In a voluntary transfer, the unit owner in exclusive possession shall be jointly and severally liable with the previous unit owner for all unpaid rents and assessments against the previous unit owner for his or her share of the common expenses up to the time of the transfer, without prejudice to the rights of the unit owner in exclusive possession to recover from the previous unit owner the amounts paid by the unit owner in exclusive possession therefor.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The liability for rents and assessments may not be avoided by waiver of the use or enjoyment of any common areas or by abandonment of the unit for which the rents and assessments are made.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Rents and assessments, and installments on them, not paid when due bear interest at the rate provided in the cooperative documents from the date due until paid. This rate may not exceed the rate allowed by law and, if a rate is not provided in the cooperative documents, accrues at 18 percent per annum. If the cooperative documents or bylaws so provide, the association may charge an administrative late fee in addition to such interest, not to exceed the greater of $25 or 5 percent of each installment of the assessment for each delinquent installment that the payment is late. Any payment received by an association must be applied first to any interest accrued by the association, then to any administrative late fee, then to any costs and reasonable attorney’s fees incurred in collection, and then to the delinquent assessment. The foregoing applies notwithstanding any restrictive endorsement, designation, or instruction placed on or accompanying a payment. A late fee is not subject to chapter 687 or s. 719.303(4).</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The association has a lien on each cooperative parcel for any unpaid rents and assessments, plus interest, and any authorized administrative late fees. If authorized by the cooperative documents, the lien also secures reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by the association incident to the collection of the rents and assessments or enforcement of such lien. The lien is effective from and after recording a claim of lien in the public records in the county in which the cooperative parcel is located which states the description of the cooperative parcel, the name of the unit owner, the amount due, and the due dates. The lien expires if a claim of lien is not filed within 1 year after the date the assessment was due, and the lien does not continue for longer than 1 year after the claim of lien has been recorded unless, within that time, an action to enforce the lien is commenced. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a lien may not be filed by the association against a cooperative parcel until 30 days after the date on which a notice of intent to file a lien has been delivered to the owner.</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The notice must be sent to the unit owner at the address of the unit by first-class United States mail and:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the most recent address of the unit owner on the records of the association is the address of the unit, the notice must be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the unit owner at the address of the unit.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the most recent address of the unit owner on the records of the association is in the United States, but is not the address of the unit, the notice must be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the unit owner at his or her most recent address.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the most recent address of the unit owner on the records of the association is not in the United States, the notice must be sent by first-class United States mail to the unit owner at his or her most recent address.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A notice that is sent pursuant to this subsection is deemed delivered upon mailing.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Liens for rents and assessments may be foreclosed by suit brought in the name of the association, in like manner as a foreclosure of a mortgage on real property. In any foreclosure, the unit owner shall pay a reasonable rental for the cooperative parcel, if so provided in the cooperative documents, and the plaintiff in the foreclosure is entitled to the appointment of a receiver to collect the rent. The association has the power, unless prohibited by the cooperative documents, to bid on the cooperative parcel at the foreclosure sale and to acquire and hold, lease, mortgage, or convey it. Suit to recover a money judgment for unpaid rents and assessments may be maintained without waiving the lien securing them.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Within 15 days after request by a unit owner or mortgagee, the association shall provide a certificate stating all assessments and other moneys owed to the association by the unit owner with respect to the cooperative parcel.
