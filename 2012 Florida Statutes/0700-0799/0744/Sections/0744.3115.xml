If any advance directive exists, the court shall specify in its order and letters of guardianship what authority, if any, the guardian shall exercise over the surrogate. Pursuant to the grounds listed in s. 765.105, the court, upon its own motion, may, with notice to the surrogate and any other appropriate parties, modify or revoke the authority of the surrogate to make health care decisions for the ward. For purposes of this section, the term “health care decision” has the same meaning as in s. 765.101.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 92-199; s. 1, ch. 94-183; s. 7, ch. 2006-178.</History></Section>
