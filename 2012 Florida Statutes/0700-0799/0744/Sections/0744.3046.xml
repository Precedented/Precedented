The declarant or declarants may also name an alternate to the guardian to act if the designated preneed guardian refuses to serve, renounces the appointment, dies, or becomes incapacitated after the death of the last surviving parent of the minor.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The written declaration must reasonably identify the declarant or declarants and the designated preneed guardian and must be signed by the declarant or declarants in the presence of at least two attesting witnesses present at the same time. The written declaration must also provide the following information for each minor child named in such declaration: the full name as it appears on the birth certificate or as ordered by a court, date of birth, and social security number, if any.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The declarant must file the declaration with the clerk of the court.
