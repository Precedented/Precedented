In addition, the Legislature finds that the best solution to this problem is to encourage each county to establish, through the Statewide Public Guardianship Office, a local office of public guardian for the purpose of providing guardianship services to incapacitated persons when a private guardian is not available. Therefore, the Legislature intends to establish the Joining Forces for Public Guardianship matching grant program for the purpose of assisting counties to establish and fund community-supported public guardianship programs.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2004-260.</History></Section>
