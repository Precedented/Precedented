The guardian of the property in this state shall cause a notice to be published once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county, that she or he has filed her or his accounting and will apply for discharge on a day certain and that jurisdiction of the ward will be transferred to the state of foreign jurisdiction. If an objection is filed to the termination of the guardianship in this state, the court shall hear the objection and enter an order either sustaining or overruling the objection.
