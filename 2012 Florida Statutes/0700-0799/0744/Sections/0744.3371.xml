If the petitioner has custody of the minor and the petition alleges that, after diligent search, the parents cannot be found, the parents may be served by informal notice, delivered to their last known address or addresses. When a parent petitions for appointment as guardian for his or her minor child, no notice is necessary unless the other parent is living and does not consent to the appointment.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 22, ch. 90-271; s. 1079, ch. 97-102.</History></Section>
