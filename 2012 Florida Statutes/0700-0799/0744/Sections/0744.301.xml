			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The parents jointly are the natural guardians of their own children and of their adopted children, during minority. If one parent dies, the surviving parent remains the sole natural guardian even if he or she remarries. If the marriage between the parents is dissolved, the natural guardianship belongs to the parent to whom sole parental responsibility has been granted, or if the parents have been granted shared parental responsibility, both continue as natural guardians. If the marriage is dissolved and neither parent is given parental responsibility for the child, neither may act as natural guardian of the child. The mother of a child born out of wedlock is the natural guardian of the child and is entitled to primary residential care and custody of the child unless the court enters an order stating otherwise.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As used in this subsection, the term “inherent risk” means those dangers or conditions, known or unknown, which are characteristic of, intrinsic to, or an integral part of the activity and which are not eliminated even if the activity provider acts with due care in a reasonably prudent manner.

				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The failure by the activity provider to warn the natural guardian or minor child of an inherent risk; and</Text>
				</SubParagraph>

YOU ARE AGREEING THAT, EVEN IF (<Directions xml:space="preserve">name of released party or parties</Directions>) USES REASONABLE CARE IN PROVIDING THIS ACTIVITY, THERE IS A CHANCE YOUR CHILD MAY BE SERIOUSLY INJURED OR KILLED BY PARTICIPATING IN THIS ACTIVITY BECAUSE THERE ARE CERTAIN DANGERS INHERENT IN THE ACTIVITY WHICH CANNOT BE AVOIDED OR ELIMINATED.

			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a waiver or release complies with paragraph (b) and waives no more than allowed under this subsection, there is a rebuttable presumption that the waiver or release is valid and that any injury or damage to the minor child arose from the inherent risk involved in the activity.</Text>

					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">To rebut the presumption that the injury or damage to the minor child arose from an inherent risk involved in the activity, a claimant must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the conduct, condition, or other cause resulting in the injury or damage was not an inherent risk of the activity.</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a presumption under this paragraph is rebutted, liability and compensatory damages must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.</Text>
