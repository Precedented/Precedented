In the event of extraordinary services rendered by such guardian, the court may, upon petition and after hearing on the petition, authorize additional compensation for the extraordinary services, payable from the estate of the ward. Provided that extraordinary services approved by the United States Department of Veteran’s Affairs do not require a court hearing for approval of the fees, but shall require an order authorizing the guardian to withdraw the amount from the guardianship account. No compensation shall be allowed on the corpus of an estate received from a preceding guardian. The guardian may be allowed from the estate of her or his ward reasonable premiums paid by the guardian to any corporate surety upon the guardian’s bond.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 14579, 1929; CGL 1936 Supp. 2146(12); s. 1, ch. 73-304; s. 14, ch. 84-62; s. 63, ch. 85-62; s. 52, ch. 93-268; s. 32, ch. 95-401; s. 1126, ch. 97-102; s. 85, ch. 99-3.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 293.12.</Text></Note></Section>
