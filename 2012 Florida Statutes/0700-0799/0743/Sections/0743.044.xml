Upon issuance of an order by a court of competent jurisdiction, such a youth is authorized to make and execute all documents, contracts, or agreements necessary for obtaining the rights, privileges, and benefits of depository financial services as if the youth is otherwise competent to make and execute contracts. Execution of any such contract or agreement for depository financial services shall have the same effect as if it were the act of a person who is not a minor. A youth seeking to enter into such contracts or agreements or execute other necessary instruments incidental to obtaining depository financial services must present an order from a court of competent jurisdiction removing the disabilities of nonage of the minor under this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 2007-147.</History></Section>
