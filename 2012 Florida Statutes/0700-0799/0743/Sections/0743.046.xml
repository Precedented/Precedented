These youth are authorized to make and execute contracts, agreements, releases, and all other instruments necessary for the purpose of securing utility services at a residential property upon the youth’s 18th birthday. The contracts or other agreements made by the youth shall have the same effect as though they were the obligations of persons who were not minors. A youth seeking to enter into such contracts or agreements or execute other necessary instruments that are incidental to securing utility services must present an order from a court of competent jurisdiction removing the disabilities of nonage of the minor under this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2008-122.</History></Section>
