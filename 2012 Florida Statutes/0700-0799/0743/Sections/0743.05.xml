Such minors are authorized to make and execute promissory notes, contracts, or other instruments necessary for the borrowing of money for this purpose. The promissory notes, contracts, or other instruments so made shall have the same effect as though they were the obligations of persons who were not minors. No such obligation shall be valid if the interest rate on it exceeds the prevailing interest rate for the federal Guaranteed Student Loan Program.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 59-268; s. 1, ch. 69-105; s. 2, ch. 71-147; s. 28, ch. 83-291.</History></Section>
