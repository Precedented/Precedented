However, the person is justified in the use of deadly force only if he or she reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent the imminent commission of a forcible felony. A person does not have a duty to retreat if the person is in a place where he or she has a right to be.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 13, ch. 74-383; s. 1189, ch. 97-102; s. 3, ch. 2005-27.</History></Section>
