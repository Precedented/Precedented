			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature acknowledges the massive downturn in the condominium market which has occurred throughout the state and the impact of such downturn on developers, lenders, unit owners, and condominium associations. Numerous condominium projects have failed or are in the process of failing such that the condominium has a small percentage of third-party unit owners as compared to the unsold inventory of units. As a result of the inability to find purchasers for this inventory of units, which results in part from the devaluing of real estate in this state, developers are unable to satisfy the requirements of their lenders, leading to defaults on mortgages. Consequently, lenders are faced with the task of finding a solution to the problem in order to receive payment for their investments.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature recognizes that all of the factors listed in this section lead to condominiums becoming distressed, resulting in detriment to the unit owners and the condominium association due to the resulting shortage of assessment moneys available for proper maintenance of the condominium. Such shortage and the resulting lack of proper maintenance further erodes property values. The Legislature finds that individuals and entities within this state and in other states have expressed interest in purchasing unsold inventory in one or more condominium projects, but are reticent to do so because of accompanying liabilities inherited from the original developer, which are by definition imputed to the successor purchaser, including a foreclosing mortgagee. This results in the potential successor purchaser having unknown and unquantifiable risks that the potential purchaser is unwilling to accept. As a result, condominium projects stagnate, leaving all parties involved at an impasse and without the ability to find a solution.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature declares that it is the public policy of this state to protect the interests of developers, lenders, unit owners, and condominium associations with regard to distressed condominiums, and that there is a need for relief from certain provisions of the Florida Condominium Act geared toward enabling economic opportunities for successor purchasers, including foreclosing mortgagees. Such relief would benefit existing unit owners and condominium associations. The Legislature further finds and declares that this situation cannot be open-ended without potentially prejudicing the rights of unit owners and condominium associations, and thereby declares that the provisions of this part may be used by purchasers of condominium inventory for only a specific and defined period.</Text>
