This section does not limit or restrict the ability of the Attorney General to bring a class action for the recovery of statutory penalties, if otherwise authorized by law. However, class action claimants may seek to obtain, if appropriate, nonmonetary relief, including injunctive relief, orders or declaratory relief, and orders or judgments enjoining wrongful conduct, regardless of whether the class action claimants can prove any actual monetary damages. This section does not in any way limit or restrict the availability of such nonmonetary relief.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This section does not affect any class action lawsuits involving federal or state civil rights laws.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2006-117.</History></Section>
