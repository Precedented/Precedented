				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Money received from an entity listed on a public stock exchange during any year of the trust or estate which exceeds 10 percent of the fair market value of the trust’s or estate’s interest in the entity on the first day of that year. The amount to be allocated to principal must be reduced to the extent that the cumulative distributions from the entity to the trust or estate allocated to income do not exceed a cumulative annual return of 3 percent of the fair market value of the interest in the entity at the beginning of each year or portion of a year for the number of years or portion of years in the period that the interest in the entity has been held by the trust or estate. If a trustee has exercised a power to adjust under s. 738.104 during any period the interest in the entity has been held by the trust, the trustee, in determining the total income distributions from that entity, must take into account the extent to which the exercise of that power resulted in income to the trust from that entity for that period. If the income of the trust for any period has been computed under s. 738.1041, the trustee, in determining the total income distributions from that entity for that period, must take into account the portion of the unitrust amount paid as a result of the ownership of the trust’s interest in the entity for that period.</Text>
