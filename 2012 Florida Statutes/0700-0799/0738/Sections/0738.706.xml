The total reimbursement shall equal the increase in the estate tax to the extent the principal used to pay the increase would have qualified for a marital deduction or charitable contribution deduction but for the payment. The proportionate share of the reimbursement for each estate, trust, or beneficiary whose income taxes are reduced shall be the same as such estate’s, trust’s, or beneficiary’s proportionate share of the total decrease in income tax. An estate or trust shall reimburse principal from income.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2002-42.</History></Section>
