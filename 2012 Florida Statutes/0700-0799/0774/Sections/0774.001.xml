This liability has created an overpowering public necessity to provide an immediate, remedial, legislative solution. The Legislature intends that the cumulative recovery by all asbestos claimants from innocent successors be limited, and intends to simply change the form of asbestos claimants’ remedies without impairing their substantive rights, and finds that there are no alternative means to meet this public necessity. The Legislature finds the public interest as a whole is best served by providing relief to these innocent successors so that they may remain viable and continue to contribute to this state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2005-269.</History></Section>
