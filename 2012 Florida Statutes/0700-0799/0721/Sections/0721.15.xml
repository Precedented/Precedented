The timeshare instrument shall provide for the allocation of common expenses among all timeshare units or timeshare interests on a reasonable basis, including timeshare interests owned or not yet sold by the developer. The timeshare instrument may provide that the common expenses allocated may differ between those timeshare units that are part of the timeshare plan and those units that are not part of the timeshare plan; however, the different proportion of expenses must be based upon reasonable differences in the benefit provided to each. The timeshare instrument shall allocate common expenses to timeshare interests owned or not yet sold by the developer on the same basis that common expenses are allocated to similar or equivalent timeshare interests sold to purchasers.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any provision of chapter 718 or chapter 719 to the contrary, the allocation of total common expenses for a condominium or a cooperative timeshare plan may vary on any reasonable basis, including, but not limited to, timeshare unit size, timeshare unit type, timeshare unit location, specific identification, or a combination of these factors, if the percentage interest in the common elements attributable to each timeshare condominium parcel or timeshare cooperative parcel equals the share of the total common expenses allocable to that parcel. The share of a timeshare interest in the common expenses allocable to the timeshare condominium parcel or the timeshare cooperative parcel containing such interest may vary on any reasonable basis if the timeshare interest’s share of its parcel’s common expense allocation is equal to that timeshare interest’s share of the percentage interest in common elements attributable to such parcel.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">After the creation or provision of a managing entity, the managing entity shall make an annual assessment against each purchaser for the payment of common expenses, based on the projected annual budget, in the amount specified by the contract between the seller and the purchaser or in the timeshare instrument.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">No owner of a timeshare interest may be excused from the payment of her or his share of the common expenses unless all owners are likewise excused from payment, except that the developer may be excused from the payment of her or his share of the common expenses which would have been assessed against her or his timeshare interests during a stated period of time during which the developer has guaranteed to each purchaser in the timeshare instrument, or by agreement between the developer and a majority of the owners of timeshare interests other than the developer, that the assessment for common expenses imposed upon the owners would not increase over a stated dollar amount. In the event of such a guarantee, the developer is obligated to pay all common expenses incurred during the guarantee period in excess of the total revenues of the timeshare plan. Notwithstanding this limitation, if a developer-controlled owners’ association has maintained all insurance coverages required by s. 721.165, the common expenses incurred during the guarantee period resulting from a natural disaster or an act of God, which are not covered by insurance proceeds from the insurance maintained by the owners’ association, may be assessed against all purchasers owning timeshare interests on the date of such natural disaster or act of God, and their successors and assigns, including the developer with respect to timeshare interests owned by the developer. In the event of such an assessment, all timeshare interests shall be assessed in accordance with their ownership interest as required by paragraph (1)(a).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purpose of calculating the obligation of a developer under a guarantee pursuant to paragraph (b), amounts expended for any insurance coverage required by law or by the timeshare instrument to be maintained by the owners’ association and depreciation expenses related to real property shall be excluded from common expenses incurred during the guarantee period, except that for real property that is used for the production of fees, revenues, or other income, depreciation expenses shall be excluded only to the extent that they exceed the net income from the production of such fees, revenues, or other income. Any special assessment imposed for amounts excluded from the developer guarantee pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid proportionately by all owners of timeshare interests, including the developer with respect to the timeshare interests owned by the developer, in accordance with the timeshare instrument.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A guarantee pursuant to paragraph (b) may provide that the developer may extend or increase the guarantee for one or more additional stated periods.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Delinquent assessments may bear interest at the highest rate permitted by law or at some lesser rate established by the managing entity. In addition to such interest, the managing entity may charge an administrative late fee in an amount not to exceed $25 for each delinquent assessment. Any costs of collection, including reasonable collection agency fees and reasonable attorney’s fees, incurred in the collection of a delinquent assessment shall be paid by the purchaser and shall be secured by a lien in favor of the managing entity upon the timeshare interest with respect to which the delinquent assessment has been incurred; however, in the event that a managing entity turns the matter over to a collection agency, the managing entity must advise the purchaser at least 60 days prior to turning the matter over to the collection agency that the purchaser may be liable for the fees of the collection agency and that a lien may result therefrom.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Unless otherwise specified in the contract between the seller and the purchaser, any common expenses benefiting fewer than all purchasers shall be assessed only against those purchasers benefited.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any assessments for common expenses which have not been spent for common expenses during the year for which such assessments were made shall be shown as an item on the annual budget.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any contrary requirements of s. 718.112(2)(g) or s. 719.106(1)(g), for timeshare plans subject to this chapter, assessments against purchasers need not be made more frequently than annually.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A purchaser, regardless of how her or his timeshare estate or timeshare license has been acquired, including a purchaser at a judicial sale, is personally liable for all assessments for common expenses which come due while the purchaser is the owner of such interest.
