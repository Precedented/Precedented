Such notice shall be provided on forms furnished by the association and shall include a clear and concise explanation of a patient’s rights and limitations under the plan. The hospital or the participating physician may elect to have the patient sign a form acknowledging receipt of the notice form. Signature of the patient acknowledging receipt of the notice form raises a rebuttable presumption that the notice requirements of this section have been met. Notice need not be given to a patient when the patient has an emergency medical condition as defined in s. 395.002(8)(b) or when notice is not practicable.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 75, ch. 88-1; s. 8, ch. 89-186; s. 4, ch. 98-113; s. 91, ch. 99-3; s. 205, ch. 2007-230.</History></Section>
