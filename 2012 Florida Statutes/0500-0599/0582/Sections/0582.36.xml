To assist the supervisors in determining such question, a referendum shall be held by the supervisors upon the proposition of the creation of the proposed district. Due notice of such referendum shall be given by the supervisors, and ballots therefor shall be in substantially the form set forth in s. 582.12, but the proposed district and name thereof shall be substituted for the soil and water conservation district, and the millage rate to be approved by the electors who are owners of freeholds within the proposed district not wholly exempt from taxation shall be included. At such referendum each owner of land lying within the proposed district shall be entitled to cast one vote, in person or by proxy, for each acre or fractional part thereof of land within the proposed district belonging to such owner, except that only one vote may be cast for each such acre or fractional part thereof regardless of whether the legal title thereto is held in single or multiple ownership. The supervisors may prescribe such rules and regulations governing the conduct of the hearing and referendum as they deem necessary.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 69-235; ss. 14, 35, ch. 69-106.</History></Section>
