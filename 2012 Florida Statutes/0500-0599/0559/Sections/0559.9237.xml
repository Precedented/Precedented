A charge pursuant to a rental-purchase agreement for a lessee’s failure to make a timely rental renewal payment may be collected only once on any accrued payment, no matter how long it remains unpaid. Such a charge may be collected at the time it accrues or any time thereafter. Such a charge may not be assessed against a payment that is timely made, even though an earlier charge has not been paid in full. A rental-purchase agreement may provide for the payment of reasonable attorney’s fees incurred by an attorney, not a salaried employee of the lessor, in the course of collection, and for the payment of court costs.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 88-69.</History></Section>
