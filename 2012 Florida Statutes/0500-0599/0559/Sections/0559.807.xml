The amount of the bond, certificate of deposit, or guaranteed letter of credit shall be an amount not less than $50,000.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The bond, certificate of deposit, or guaranteed letter of credit shall be in the favor of the department for the use and benefit of any person who is injured by the fraud, misrepresentation, breach of contract, financial failure, or violation of any provision of this part by the seller. Such liability may be enforced by filing an action at law in a court of competent jurisdiction without precluding enforcement in an administrative action pursuant to chapter 120. However, the bond, certificate of deposit, or guaranteed letter of credit shall be amenable and enforceable only by and through administrative proceedings before the department. A money judgment resulting from an action at law, less any award for costs and attorney’s fees, shall be prima facie evidence sufficient to establish the value of the claim in an administrative action. It is the intent of the Legislature that such bond, certificate of deposit, or guaranteed letter of credit shall be applicable and liable only for payment of claims duly adjudicated by order of the department. The bond, certificate of deposit, or guaranteed letter of credit shall be open to successive claims but the aggregate amount may not exceed the amount of the bond, certificate of deposit, or guaranteed letter of credit.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 79-374; s. 85, ch. 92-291; s. 65, ch. 2000-154; s. 13, ch. 2001-214.</History></Section>
