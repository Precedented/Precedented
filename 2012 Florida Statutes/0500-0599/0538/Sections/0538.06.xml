However, the hold may be extended beyond 90 days by a court of competent jurisdiction upon a finding of probable cause that the property is stolen and further holding is necessary for the purposes of trial or to safeguard such property. The dealer shall assume all responsibility, civil or criminal, relative to the property or evidence in question, including responsibility for the actions of any employee with respect thereto.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">While a hold order is in effect, the secondhand dealer must, upon request, release the property subject to the hold order to the custody of a law enforcement officer with jurisdiction for use in a criminal investigation.

Upon completion of the criminal proceeding, the property must be returned to the secondhand dealer unless the court orders other disposition. When such other disposition is ordered, the court shall additionally order the person from whom the secondhand dealer acquired the property to pay restitution to the secondhand dealer in the amount that the secondhand dealer paid for the property together with reasonable attorney’s fees and costs.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">All dealers in secondhand property regulated by this chapter shall maintain transaction records for 3 years.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 89-533; s. 1, ch. 90-192; s. 4, ch. 90-318; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 3, ch. 93-97; s. 2, ch. 95-287; s. 21, ch. 2000-138; s. 4, ch. 2006-201.</History></Section>
