			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A secondhand dealer shall not engage in the business of purchasing, consigning, or trading secondhand goods from any location without registering with the Department of Revenue. A fee equal to the federal and state costs for processing required fingerprints must be submitted to the department with each application for registration. One application is required for each dealer. If a secondhand dealer is the owner of more than one secondhand store location, the application must list each location, and the department shall issue a duplicate registration for each location. For purposes of subsections (4) and (5) of this section, these duplicate registrations shall be deemed individual registrations. A dealer shall pay a fee of $6 per location at the time of registration and an annual renewal fee of $6 per location on October 1 of each year. All fees collected, less costs of administration, shall be transferred into the Operating Trust Fund. The Department of Revenue shall forward the full set of fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement for state and federal processing, provided the federal service is available, to be processed for any criminal justice information as defined in s. 943.045. The cost of processing such fingerprints shall be payable to the Department of Law Enforcement by the Department of Revenue. The department may issue a temporary registration to each location pending completion of the background check by state and federal law enforcement agencies, but shall revoke such temporary registration if the completed background check reveals a prohibited criminal background. An applicant for a secondhand dealer registration must be a natural person who has reached the age of 18 years.</Text>
