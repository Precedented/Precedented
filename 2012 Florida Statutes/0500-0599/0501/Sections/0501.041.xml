If the down payment includes goods traded in, the goods must be tendered in substantially as good condition as when received by the seller. If the seller fails to tender the goods, the buyer may elect to recover an amount equal to the trade-in allowance stated in the agreement. Until the seller has complied with the obligations imposed by this section, the buyer may retain possession of goods delivered to her or him by the seller and has a lien on the goods in her or his possession or control for any recovery to which she or he is entitled.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 70-363; s. 2, ch. 85-5; s. 613, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
