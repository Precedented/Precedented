If the seller fails to demand possession of goods within a reasonable time after cancellation or revocation, the goods become the property of the buyer without obligation to pay for them. For the purposes of this section, 40 days is presumed to be a reasonable time. The buyer has the duty to take reasonable care of the goods in his or her possession before cancellation or revocation and for a reasonable time thereafter, during which time the goods are otherwise at the seller’s risk. If the seller has performed any services pursuant to a home solicitation sale prior to its cancellation, the seller is entitled to no compensation for such services.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 70-363; s. 3, ch. 85-5; s. 614, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
