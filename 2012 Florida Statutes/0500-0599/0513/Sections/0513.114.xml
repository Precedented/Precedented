However, if the recreational vehicle park gave a receipt for the property, which receipt had a statement of the property value on a form which stated, in type large enough to be clearly noticeable, that such park was not liable for a greater amount than $1,000 for any loss exceeding $1,000 and was only liable for an amount up to $1,000 if the loss was the proximate result of fault or negligence of the operator, the liability of the operator is limited to $1,000 for such loss.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The operator of a recreational vehicle park is not liable or responsible to any guest for the loss of wearing apparel, goods, or other property, except as provided in subsection (1), unless such loss occurred as the proximate result of fault or negligence of such operator; and, in case of fault or negligence, the operator is not liable for a greater sum than $500, unless the guest, prior to the loss or damage, filed with the operator an inventory of the guest’s effects and their value and the operator was given an opportunity to inspect such effects and check them against such inventory. The operator of a recreational vehicle park is not liable or responsible to any guest for a greater amount than $1,000 for the loss of effects listed in such inventory as having a value of a total amount exceeding $1,000.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 84-182; s. 1, ch. 85-65; s. 63, ch. 87-225; s. 36, ch. 92-78; s. 18, ch. 93-150.</History></Section>
