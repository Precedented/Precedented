Such posting of rates must show the maximum amount charged for occupancy; the amount charged for extra conveniences, more complete accommodations, or additional furnishings; and the dates during the year when such charges prevail. Copies of the posted rate schedules for all similar rental sites in each recreational vehicle park must be filed with the department at least 5 days before such rates are to become effective and must be kept current. The rates posted may not exceed those rates on file with the department, and a recreational vehicle park may not charge more than the rates posted and filed with the department.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A person may not display, or cause to be displayed, a sign that may be seen from a public highway or street and that includes a statement or numbers relating to the rates charged at a recreational vehicle park renting by the day or week, unless such sign includes in letters and figures of similar size and prominence a statement as to: the number of rental sites in the park; the rates charged for each rental site; and the dates during which such rates are in effect. In each instance, the rates charged may not exceed the rates posted in the registration area of the park and those filed with the department.
