As such, the department shall administer and enforce, with respect to such parks and camps, laws and rules relating to sanitation, control of communicable diseases, illnesses and hazards to health among humans and from animals to humans, and the general health of the people of the state. However, nothing in this chapter qualifies a mobile home park, a lodging park, a recreational vehicle park, or a recreational camp for a liquor license issued under s. 561.20(2)(a)1.
