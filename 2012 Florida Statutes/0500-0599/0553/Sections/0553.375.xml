		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Prior to the relocation to a site that has a higher design wind speed, modification, or change of occupancy of a manufactured building within the state, the manufacturer, dealer, or owner thereof may apply to the department for recertification of that manufactured building. The department shall, by rule, provide what information the applicant must submit for recertification and for plan review and inspection of such manufactured buildings and shall establish fees for recertification. Upon a determination by the department that the manufactured building complies with the applicable building codes, the department shall issue a recertification insignia. A manufactured building that bears recertification insignia does not require any additional approval by an enforcement jurisdiction in which the building is sold or installed, and is considered to comply with all applicable codes. As an alternative to recertification by the department, the manufacturer, dealer, or owner of a manufactured building may seek appropriate permitting and a certificate of occupancy from the local jurisdiction in accordance with procedures generally applicable under the Florida Building Code.</Text>
