		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any other law or ordinance to the contrary, in order to expand the availability of affordable housing in this state, any residential manufactured building that is certified under this chapter by the department may be placed on a mobile home lot in a mobile home park, recreational vehicle park, or mobile home condominium, cooperative, or subdivision. Any such housing unit placed on a mobile home lot is a mobile home for purposes of chapter 723 and, therefore, all rights, obligations, and duties under chapter 723 apply, including the specifics of the prospectus. However, a housing unit subject to this section may not be placed on a mobile home lot without the prior written approval of the park owner. Each housing unit subject to this section shall be taxed as a mobile home under s. 320.08(11) and is subject to payments to the Florida Mobile Home Relocation Fund under s. 723.06116.</Text>
