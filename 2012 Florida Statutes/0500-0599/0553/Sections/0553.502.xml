All state laws, rules, standards, and codes governing facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act Standards for Accessible Design shall be maintained to assure certification of the state’s construction standards and codes. This part is not intended to expand or diminish the defenses available to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the standards, including, but not limited to, the readily achievable standard, and the standards applicable to alterations to private buildings or facilities as defined by the standards.</Text>
