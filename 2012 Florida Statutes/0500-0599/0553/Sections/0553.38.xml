Such local requirements and rules which may be enacted by local authorities must be reasonable and uniformly applied and enforced without any distinction as to whether a building is a conventionally constructed or manufactured building. A local government shall require permit fees only for those inspections actually performed by the local government for the installation of a factory-built structure. Such fees shall be equal to the amount charged for similar inspections on conventionally built housing.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 71-172; s. 1, ch. 74-208; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 3, ch. 78-323; ss. 1, 6, ch. 79-152; ss. 2, 4, ch. 80-86; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 3, 4, ch. 84-32; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 60, ch. 2000-141; s. 34, ch. 2001-186; s. 3, ch. 2001-372.</History></Section>
