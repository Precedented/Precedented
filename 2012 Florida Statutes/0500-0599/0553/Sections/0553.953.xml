The standards shall be based on feasible and attainable efficiencies which will reduce Florida’s energy consumption growth rate and the growth rate of energy demand. Standards adopted pursuant to this part shall be cost-effective to the majority of the users and shall consider the expected life of the covered product. Such standards shall collectively be known and may be cited as “Florida Energy Conservation Standards.”</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature recognizes that energy conservation is an important element of the energy policy of this state. Further, it is the policy of the state and the intent of the Legislature to employ a range of measures to reduce wasteful, uneconomical, and unnecessary uses of energy, thereby reducing the rate of growth of energy consumption and prudently conserving energy resources. The Legislature finds that increased product efficiency can contribute significantly toward energy conservation. It is the intent of the Legislature to bring about increased product efficiency through adoption of energy conservation standards.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 87-271.</History></Section>
