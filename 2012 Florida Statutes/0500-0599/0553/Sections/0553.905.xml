HVAC equipment mounted in an attic or a garage shall not be required to have supplemental insulation in addition to that installed by the manufacturer. All new residential buildings, except those herein exempted, shall have insulation in ceilings rated at R-19 or more, space permitting. Thermal efficiency standards do not apply to a building of less than 1,000 square feet which is not primarily used as a principal residence and which is constructed and owned by a natural person for hunting or similar recreational purposes; however, no such person may build more than one exempt building in any 12-month period.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-128; s. 1, ch. 78-625; s. 2, ch. 79-267; s. 2, ch. 80-193; s. 3, ch. 81-226; s. 5, ch. 84-273; s. 8, ch. 93-249; s. 55, ch. 98-287.</History></Section>
