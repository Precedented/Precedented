			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Florida Forest Service may prohibit on state forest lands, or any lands leased by or otherwise assigned to the Florida Forest Service for management purposes, activities that interfere with management objectives, create a nuisance, or pose a threat to public safety. Such prohibited activities must be posted with signs not more than 500 feet apart along, and at each corner of, the boundaries of the land. The signs must be placed along the boundary line of posted land in a manner and in such position as to be clearly noticeable from outside the boundary line. A person who violates the provisions of this subsection commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Florida Forest Service may enter into contracts or agreements, with or without competitive bidding or procurement, to make available, on a fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis, property and other structures under Florida Forest Service control for the placement of new facilities by any wireless provider of mobile service as defined in 47 U.S.C. s. 153(27) or 47 U.S.C. s. 332(d) or any telecommunications company as defined in s. 364.02 when it is determined to be practical and feasible to make such property or other structures available. The Florida Forest Service may, without adopting a rule, charge a just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory fee for the placement of the facilities, payable annually, based on the fair market value of space used by comparable communications facilities in the state. The Florida Forest Service and a wireless provider or telecommunications company may negotiate the reduction or elimination of a fee in consideration of services provided to the Florida Forest Service by the wireless provider or telecommunications company. All such fees collected by the Florida Forest Service shall be deposited in the Incidental Trust Fund.</Text>
