		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any money budgeted for a fiscal period shall be expended by the Florida Forest Service during the period for which it was budgeted and amounts not expended or specifically obligated by contract or other legal procedure during that period shall be available for the next fiscal period or shall be returned to the Florida Forest Service and the county or municipality in the same proportions as appropriated. However, when 40 percent of the cost of 1 person-year of assistance equals or exceeds $3,000, then in that event all budget balance will revert to the Florida Forest Service.</Text>
