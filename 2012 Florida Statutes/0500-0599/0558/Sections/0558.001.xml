An effective alternative dispute resolution mechanism in certain construction defect matters should involve the claimant filing a notice of claim with the contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or design professional that the claimant asserts is responsible for the defect, and should provide the contractor, subcontractor, supplier, or design professional with an opportunity to resolve the claim without resort to further legal process.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2003-49; s. 1, ch. 2004-342; s. 1, ch. 2006-281.</History></Section>
