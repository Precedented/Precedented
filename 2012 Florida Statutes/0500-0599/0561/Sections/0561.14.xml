It is the finding of the Legislature that bottle clubs are susceptible to a distinct and separate classification under the Beverage Law for purposes of regulating establishments permitting the consumption of alcoholic beverages. Any person operating a bottle club must be licensed pursuant to this chapter and may not hold any other alcoholic beverage license for such premises while licensed as a bottle club. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to permit the purchase at wholesale or retail of alcoholic beverages for supplying or reselling to the patrons pursuant to a license issued under this chapter. Any such business shall be subject to all general, special, and local laws regulating vendors of alcoholic beverages. Bottle club licenses shall be issued at a fee of $500 annually and shall be renewed in accordance with the schedule set out in ss. 561.26 and 561.27. This subsection shall include bottle clubs in existence on January 1, 1991. The Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco is hereby authorized to adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this section.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Exporters registered to sell alcoholic beverages.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 16774, 1935; CGL 1936 Supp. 4151(230); s. 1, ch. 19499, 1939; s. 2, ch. 25359, 1949; s. 10, ch. 26484, 1951; s. 11, ch. 57-420; s. 1, ch. 63-562; s. 1, ch. 72-230; s. 1, ch. 72-272; s. 5, ch. 79-163; s. 14, ch. 81-158; s. 3, ch. 83-79; s. 1, ch. 85-62; s. 4, ch. 89-361; s. 2, ch. 90-233; s. 6, ch. 91-60; s. 3, ch. 95-346.</History></Section>
