However, such cash-only restriction does not apply if the entity holding a temporary license pursuant to this section purchases alcoholic beverages as part of a single-transaction cooperative purchase placed by a pool buying agent or if such entity is also the holder of a state beverage license authorizing the purchase of the same type of alcoholic beverages as authorized under the temporary license.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon the filing of an application for change of location pursuant to s. 561.33 by any qualified licensee who possesses a beverage license of any type or series, which application does not on its face disclose any reason for denying an alcoholic beverage license, the licensee is entitled as a matter of right to receive a temporary beverage license of the same series as that license held by the licensee to be valid for all purposes under the Beverage Law until the application is denied or until 14 days after the application is approved.

Such temporary license shall be issued by the district supervisor of the district in which the application for change of type or series is made. If the department issues a notice of intent to deny the license application for failure of the applicant to disclose the information required by s. 561.15(2) or (4), the temporary license for transfer, change of location, or change of type of series expires and shall not be extended during any proceeding for administrative or judicial review pursuant to chapter 120. If the fee for the type or series or license applied for is greater than the fee for the license then held by the applicant, the applicant for such temporary license must pay a fee in the amount of $100 or one-fourth of the difference between the fees, whichever amount is greater. A fee is not required for an application for a temporary license of a type or series for which the fee is the same as or less than the fee for the license then held by the applicant. The holder of a temporary license under this subsection is subject to the same rights, privileges, duties, and limitations of a beverage licensee as are provided by law.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the transfer or issuance of temporary licenses contrary to the county-by-county limitation on the number of such licenses based on population as provided in s. 561.20(1).</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 71-229; s. 1, ch. 72-230; s. 5, ch. 81-166; s. 1, ch. 83-180; s. 4, ch. 84-262; s. 4, ch. 90-17; s. 12, ch. 91-60; s. 10, ch. 95-346; s. 9, ch. 2000-191.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 561.321.</Text></Note></Section>
