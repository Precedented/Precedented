				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">There is created the Florida Disaster Motor Fuel Supplier Program within the Division of Emergency Management.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Participation in the program shall be at the option of each county governing body. In counties choosing to participate in the program, the local emergency management agency shall be primarily responsible for administering the program within those counties. Nothing in this section requires participation in the program.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In participating counties, the Florida Disaster Motor Fuel Supplier Program shall allow any retail motor fuel outlet doing business in those counties to participate in a network of emergency responders to provide fuel supplies and services to government agencies, medical institutions and facilities, critical infrastructure, and other responders, as well as the general public, during a declared disaster as described in s. 252.36(2).</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Retail motor fuel outlets doing business in participating counties that choose to become members of the Florida Disaster Motor Fuel Supplier Program must be able to demonstrate the capability to provide onsite fuel dispensing services to other members of the State Emergency Response Team within 24 hours after a major disaster has occurred and agree to make such service available as needed. Local emergency management agencies may determine appropriate measures for determining such readiness, including acceptance of a written attestation from the retail motor fuel outlet, a copy of an executed contract for services, or other documents or activities that demonstrate readiness. Participating retail motor fuel outlets may choose to sell motor fuel through a preexisting contract with local, state, or federal response agencies or may provide point-of-sale service to such agencies. In addition, participating retail motor fuel outlets may choose to sell motor fuel to the general public upon compliance with requirements to provide service under ss. 252.35 and 252.38 as directed by county or state emergency management officials. This section does not preclude any retail motor fuel outlet from selling fuel during lawful operating hours. Nonparticipating motor fuel retail outlets may not operate during declared curfew hours. If requested, appropriate law enforcement or security personnel may be provided through emergency management protocol to the participating business for the purpose of maintaining civil order during operating hours.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="e">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Motor fuel outlets that choose to participate in the Florida Disaster Motor Fuel Supplier Program pursuant to paragraph (d) may be issued a State Emergency Response Team logo by the participating county emergency management agency for public display to alert emergency responders and the public that the business is capable of assisting in an emergency.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="f">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Counties that choose to participate in the Florida Disaster Motor Fuel Supplier Program may charge a fee to cover the actual costs of accepting a retail motor fuel outlet into the program, including the cost of performing any required review, filing of necessary forms, and producing logo decals for public display. Additional charges may not be imposed for processing individual documents associated with the program. Funds collected shall be deposited into an appropriate county operating account.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Persons who are designated as members of the State Emergency Response Team and who can produce appropriate identification, as determined by state or county emergency management officials, shall be given priority for purchasing fuel at businesses designated as members of the State Emergency Response Team. A business may be directed by county or state emergency management officials to remain open during a declared curfew in order to provide service for emergency personnel. Under such direction, the business is not in violation of the curfew and may not be penalized for such operation and the emergency personnel are not in violation of the curfew. A person traveling during a curfew must be able to produce valid official documentation of his or her position with the State Emergency Response Team or the local emergency management agency. Such documentation may include, but need not be limited to, a current SERT identification badge, current law enforcement or other response agency identification or shield, current health care employee identification card, or current government services identification card indicating a critical services position.</Text>
