If a wholesaler receives a rebate, rent subsidy, or concession, the wholesaler must offer the rebate, rent subsidy, or concession, or the equivalent of the rebate, rent subsidy, or concession, to any retail outlet supplied by such wholesaler on proportionately equal terms. However, a rebate, rent subsidy, or concession made in good faith to meet the same or a comparable rebate, rent subsidy, or concession of a competitor shall not be a violation of this act, provided that a refiner who sells motor fuel to any wholesaler or dealer under written contract for resale in the relevant geographic market shall offer the rebate, rent subsidy, or concession, or the equivalent of such rebate, rent subsidy, or concession, to all other similarly situated wholesalers and dealers on proportionately equal terms.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 85-74; s. 4, ch. 91-247.</History></Section>
