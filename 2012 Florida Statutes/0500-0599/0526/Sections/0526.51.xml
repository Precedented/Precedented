				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Application for registration of each brand of brake fluid shall be made on forms supplied by the department. The applicant shall give his or her name and address and the brand name of the brake fluid, state that he or she owns the brand name and has complete control over the product sold thereunder in this state, and provide the name and address of the resident agent in this state. If the applicant does not own the brand name but wishes to register the product with the department, a notarized affidavit that gives the applicant full authorization to register the brand name and that is signed by the owner of the brand name must accompany the application for registration. The affidavit must include all affected brand names, the owner’s company or corporate name and address, the applicant’s company or corporate name and address, and a statement from the owner authorizing the applicant to register the product with the department. The owner of the brand name shall maintain complete control over each product sold under that brand name in this state. All first-time applications for a brand and formula combination must be accompanied by a certified report from an independent testing laboratory, setting forth the analysis of the brake fluid which shows its quality to be not less than the specifications established by the department for brake fluids. A sample of not less than 24 fluid ounces of brake fluid shall be submitted, in a container or containers, with labels representing exactly how the containers of brake fluid will be labeled when sold, and the sample and container shall be analyzed and inspected by the department in order that compliance with the department’s specifications and labeling requirements may be verified. Upon approval of the application, the department shall register the brand name of the brake fluid and issue to the applicant a permit authorizing the registrant to sell the brake fluid in this state during the permit year specified in the permit.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each applicant shall pay a fee of $100 with each application. A permit may be renewed by application to the department, accompanied by a renewal fee of $50 on or before the last day of the permit year immediately preceding the permit year for which application is made for renewal of registration. To reregister a previously registered brand and formula combination, an applicant must submit a completed application and all materials as required in this section to the department before the first day of the permit year. A brand and formula combination for which a completed application and all materials required in this section are not received before the first day of the permit year may not be registered with the department until a completed application and all materials required in this section have been received and approved. If the brand and formula combination was previously registered with the department and a fee, application, or materials required in this section are received after the first day of the permit year, a penalty of $25 accrues, which shall be added to the fee. Renewals shall be accepted only on brake fluids that have no change in formula, composition, or brand name. Any change in formula, composition, or brand name of any brake fluid constitutes a new product that must be registered in accordance with this part.</Text>
