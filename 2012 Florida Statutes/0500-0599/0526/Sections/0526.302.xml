Predatory practices and, under certain conditions, discriminatory practices, are unfair trade practices and restraints which adversely affect motor fuel competition. It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage competition and promote the general welfare of citizens of this state by prohibiting such unfair practices.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 85-74.</History></Section>
