The department shall review and revise such rules as necessary, but not less than biennially. Sanitation and safety standards shall be limited to matters relating to source of water supply; microbiological, chemical, and physical quality of water in the pool or bathing area; method of water purification, treatment, and disinfection; lifesaving apparatus; and measures to ensure safety of bathers.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department may not establish by rule any regulation governing the design, alteration, modification, or repair of public swimming pools and bathing places which has no impact on sanitation and safety of persons using public swimming pools and bathing places. Further, the department may not adopt by rule any regulation governing the construction, erection, or demolition of public swimming pools and bathing places. It is the intent of the Legislature to preempt those functions to the Florida Building Commission through adoption and maintenance of the Florida Building Code. The department shall provide technical assistance to the commission in updating the construction standards of the Florida Building Code which govern public swimming pools. This subsection does not abrogate the authority of the department to adopt and enforce appropriate sanitary regulations and requirements as authorized in subsection (1).</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 2, 14, ch. 85-173; s. 65, ch. 87-225; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 49, ch. 2000-141; s. 48, ch. 2000-242; s. 27, ch. 2000-367; s. 34, ch. 2001-186; s. 3, ch. 2001-372; s. 104, ch. 2012-184.</History></Section>
