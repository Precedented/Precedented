Registration may be renewed, upon application and payment of a renewal fee of $5, for successive 5-year periods, each ending at midnight on the last day of the month 5 years from the date of renewal. At least 60 days prior to the expiration of a registration, the department shall notify by letter the registered owner of the mark or brand that, upon application for renewal and payment of the renewal fee, the department will issue a renewal certificate granting the registered owner exclusive ownership and use of the mark or brand for another 5-year period ending at midnight on the last day of the month 5 years from the date of renewal. Failure to make application for renewal within the month of expiration of a registration will cause the department to send a second notice to the registered owner by mail at her or his last known address. Failure of the registered owner to make application for renewal within 30 days after receipt of the second notice will cause the owner’s mark or brand to be placed on an inactive list for a period of 12 months, after which it will be canceled and become subject to registration by another person.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-357; ss. 14, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 1, ch. 70-152; s. 1, ch. 70-439; s. 1, ch. 75-37; s. 2, ch. 95-220; s. 736, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
