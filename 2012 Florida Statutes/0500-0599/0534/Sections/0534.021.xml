Any livestock owner who uses a mark or brand to identify her or his livestock must register the mark or brand by applying to the department. The application must be made on a form prescribed by the department and must be accompanied by a facsimile of the brand applied for and a statement identifying the county in which the applicant has or expects to have livestock bearing the mark or brand to be recorded. The department shall, upon its satisfaction that the application meets the requirements of this chapter, record the mark or brand for exclusive statewide use by the applicant. If an application is made to record a mark or brand previously recorded, the department shall determine whether the county in which the mark or brand will be used is near enough to another county in which the previously recorded mark or brand is used to cause confusion or to aid theft or dishonesty, and if so, the department must decline to admit to record the mark or brand. If a conflict arises between the owner of any recorded mark or brand and another claiming the right to record the same mark or brand, the department must give preference to the present owner. The department shall charge and collect at the time of recording a fee of $10 for each mark or brand. A person may not use any mark or brand to which another has a prior right of record. It is unlawful to brand any animal with a brand not registered with the department.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-357; s. 1, ch. 69-333; ss. 14, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 1, ch. 75-37; s. 1, ch. 95-220; s. 735, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
