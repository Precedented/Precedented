The office may administer oaths and affirmations to any person whose testimony is required. If any person refuses to testify, produce books, records, and documents, or otherwise refuses to obey a subpoena issued under this section, the office may present its petition to a court of competent jurisdiction in or for the county in which such person resides or has its principal place of business, whereupon the court shall issue its rule nisi requiring such person to obey forthwith the subpoena issued by the office or show cause for failing to obey such subpoena. Unless the person shows sufficient cause for failing to obey the subpoena, the court shall forthwith direct such person to obey the subpoena, subject to such punishment as the court may direct, including, but not limited to, the restraint, by injunction or by appointment of a receiver, of any transfer, pledge, assignment, or other disposition of such person’s assets or any concealment, alteration, destruction, or other disposition of subpoenaed books, records, or documents as the court deems appropriate, until such person has fully complied with such subpoena and the office has completed its investigation or examination. The office is entitled to the summary procedure provided in s. 51.011, and the court shall advance the cause on its calendar. Costs incurred by the office to obtain an order granting, in whole or in part, its petition shall be taxed against the subpoenaed person, and failure to comply with such order is a contempt of court. Witnesses are entitled to the same fees and mileage as they are entitled to by law for attending as witnesses in the circuit court, unless such examination or investigation is held at the place of business or residence of the witness.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In addition to any other powers conferred upon it to enforce or administer this chapter, the office may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce or administer any provision of this chapter, any rule or order adopted pursuant to this chapter, or any written agreement entered into with the office.
