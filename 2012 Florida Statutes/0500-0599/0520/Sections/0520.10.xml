The provisions of this act relating to minimum finance charges under s. 520.08(2) and acquisition costs under the refund schedule in s. 520.09 shall not apply in calculating refinance charges on the contract extended, deferred, renewed, or restated. If all unpaid installments are deferred, the holder may, at her or his election, charge and collect for such deferment an amount equal to the difference between the refund required for prepayment in full under s. 520.09 as of the scheduled due date of the first deferred installment and the refund required for prepayment in full as of 1 month prior to said date times the number of months in which no scheduled payment is made.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 9, ch. 57-799; s. 8, ch. 59-456; s. 5, ch. 69-370; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 6, 21, ch. 80-256; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 35, 36, ch. 90-103; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 689, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
