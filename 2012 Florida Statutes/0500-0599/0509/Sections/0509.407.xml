If the property is not so found but is in another jurisdiction, the officer shall deliver the writ to the proper authority in the other jurisdiction. The writ shall be executed by levying on such property and delivering it to the officer of the court in which the action is pending, to be disposed of according to law, unless the officer is ordered by such court to hold the property and dispose of it according to law. If the defendant cannot be found, the levy on the property suffices as service if the plaintiff and the officer each file a sworn statement stating that the whereabouts of the defendant are unknown.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-249; ss. 33, 39, 42, ch. 79-240; ss. 3, 4, ch. 81-161; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 41, 51, 52, ch. 90-339; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
