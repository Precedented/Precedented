When a pest or disease is thus determined to be dangerous, transmissible, or threatening to an agricultural interest of the state, it shall be known as a “reportable disease.” Each reportable disease shall be included by rule on the department’s dangerous transmissible disease list. When necessary because of the possible impact of an animal disease on public health, the department may consult with the Department of Health regarding an animal disease that is transmissible to humans.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 17273, 1935; CGL 1936 Supp. 3323(3); s. 4, ch. 25358, 1949; s. 8, ch. 59-457; s. 1, ch. 63-356; ss. 14, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 1, ch. 84-72; s. 17, ch. 90-321; s. 12, ch. 96-231; s. 256, ch. 99-8.</History></Section>
