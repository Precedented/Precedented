The only exceptions are those areas required by federal law, rule, or cooperative agreement to be regulated by another agency. The Legislature declares that, in order to effectively support the growth of aquaculture in this state, there is a need for a state aquaculture plan that will provide for the coordination and prioritization of state aquaculture efforts and the conservation and enhancement of aquatic resources and will provide mechanisms for increasing aquaculture production which may lead to the creation of new industries, job opportunities, income for aquaculturists, and other benefits to the state. The state aquaculture plan shall guide the research and development of the aquaculture industry. Funds designated by the Legislature for aquaculture research and development or for contracting for aquaculture research and development shall be used to address the projects and activities designated in the state aquaculture plan. Any entity receiving legislative funding for aquaculture research and development programs shall report annually to the department all activities related to aquaculture to facilitate coordination and compliance with the state aquaculture plan.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 84-90; s. 3, ch. 90-92; s. 8, ch. 91-187; s. 24, ch. 96-247; s. 24, ch. 98-333.</History></Section>
