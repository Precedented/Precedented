Every signature upon every recall petition must be signed in the presence of the clerk of the board of county commissioners at the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county, and the petitioner must present at the time of such signing her or his registration receipt showing the petitioner’s qualification as an elector of the county at the time of the signing of the petition. Not more than one permit may be included in any one petition; and, in all elections in which the recall of more than one permit is voted on, the voters shall be given an opportunity to vote for or against the recall of each permit separately. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the holding of later referendum or recall elections.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 23, ch. 92-348; s. 787, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
