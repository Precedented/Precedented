If a permitholder rebroadcasts such signal and elects to impose a surcharge, the surcharge shall be imposed on any winning ticket at any guest facility at the same rate as the surcharge on wagers accepted at its own facility. The proceeds from the surcharge shall be distributed as follows: if the wager is made at the host facility, then one-half of the proceeds shall be retained by the host permitholder and one-half shall be paid as purses at the host facility; if the wager is made at a guest facility, then one-half shall be retained by the guest permitholder, one-quarter shall be paid to the host permitholder, and one-quarter shall be paid as purses at the host facility.</Text></Subsection><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">Any surcharge taken under this section must be calculated after breakage is deducted from the wagering pool.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 52, ch. 92-348; s. 18, ch. 96-364.</History></Section>
