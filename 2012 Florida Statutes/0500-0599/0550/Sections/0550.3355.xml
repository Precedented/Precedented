		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any harness track licensed to operate under the provisions of s. 550.375 may make application for, and shall be issued by the division, a license to operate not more than 50 quarter horse racing days during the summer season, which shall extend from July 1 until October 1 of each year. However, this license to operate quarter horse racing for 50 days is in addition to the racing days and dates provided in s. 550.375 for harness racing during the winter seasons; and, it does not affect the right of such licensee to operate harness racing at the track as provided in s. 550.375 during the winter season. All provisions of this chapter governing quarter horse racing not in conflict herewith apply to the operation of quarter horse meetings authorized hereunder, except that all quarter horse racing permitted hereunder shall be conducted at night.</Text>
