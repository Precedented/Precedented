It is unlawful for any person to remove, use, or dispose of such detained or embargoed article or processing equipment by sale or otherwise without such permission.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If an article or processing equipment detained or embargoed under subsection (1) has been found by the department to be in violation of law or rule, the department may, within a reasonable period of time after the issuance of such notice, petition the circuit court, in the jurisdiction of which the article or processing equipment is detained or embargoed, for an order for condemnation of such article or processing equipment.
