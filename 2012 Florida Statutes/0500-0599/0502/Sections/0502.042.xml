For purposes of this requirement, to “legibly label” means to label the package or container with conspicuous and easily readable boldfaced print or type in distinct contrast to the background, by color. The department shall periodically conduct shelf-life studies to review the keeping quality of milk and milk products and shall sample periodically the products of the dairy processors to determine if the shelf-life dating used by the processors complies with the minimum standards of quality.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 72-60; s. 2, ch. 76-282; s. 5, ch. 93-68; ss. 6, 15, ch. 94-92.</History></Section>
