Upon the posting of such bond with the sheriff and the release of the property to the applicant the cause shall proceed to final judgment in the same manner as it would have had no such bond been filed, except that any execution to be issued in the cause pursuant to judgment may run against and be enforced against the person posting said bond and the person’s surety.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 29712, 1955; s. 1381, ch. 97-102.</History></Section>
