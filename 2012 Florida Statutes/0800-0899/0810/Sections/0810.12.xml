The provisions of this section shall not apply to the trimming or cutting of trees or timber by municipal or private public utilities, or their employees, contractors, or subcontractors, when such trimming is required for the establishment or maintenance of the service furnished by any such utility.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The unlawful dumping by any person of any litter in violation of s. 403.413(4) is prima facie evidence of the intention of such person to commit an act of trespass. If any waste that is dumped in violation of s. 403.413(4) is discovered to contain any article, including, but not limited to, a letter, bill, publication, or other writing that displays the name of a person thereon, addressed to such person or in any other manner indicating that the article last belonged to such person, that discovery raises a mere inference that the person so identified has violated this section. If the court finds that the discovery of the location of the article is corroborated by the existence of an independent fact or circumstance which, standing alone, would constitute evidence sufficient to prove a violation of s. 403.413(4), such person is rebuttably presumed to have violated that section.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 76-46; s. 123, ch. 94-119; s. 3, ch. 94-263; s. 1235, ch. 97-102.</History></Section>
