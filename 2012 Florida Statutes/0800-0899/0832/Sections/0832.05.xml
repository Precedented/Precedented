In any prosecution under this section, the introduction in evidence of any unpaid and dishonored check, draft, or other written order having the drawee’s refusal to pay stamped or written thereon or attached thereto, with the reason therefor as aforesaid, is prima facie evidence of the making or uttering of such check, draft, or other written order, of the due presentation to the drawee for payment and the dishonor thereof, and that the same was properly dishonored for the reasons written, stamped, or attached by the drawee on such dishonored check, draft, or other written order. As against the maker or drawer thereof, the withdrawing from deposit with the drawee named in the check, draft, or other written order of the funds on deposit with such drawee necessary to ensure payment of such check, draft, or other written order upon presentation within a reasonable time after negotiation or the drawing, making, uttering, or delivering of a check, draft, or written order, payment of which is refused by the drawee, is prima facie evidence of knowledge of insufficient funds in or credit with such drawee. However, if it is determined at the trial in a prosecution hereunder that the payee of any such check, draft, or written order, at the time of accepting such check, draft, or written order, had knowledge of or reason to believe that the drawer of such check, draft, or other written order did not have sufficient funds on deposit in or credit with such drawee, then the payee instituting such criminal prosecution shall be assessed all costs of court incurred in connection with such prosecution.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="8"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">COSTS.<EmDash />When a prosecution is initiated under this section before any committing trial court judge, the party applying for the warrant shall be held liable for costs accruing in the event the case is dismissed for want of prosecution.
