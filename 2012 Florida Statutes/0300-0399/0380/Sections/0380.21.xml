The enactment of this legislation shall not in any other way affect any existing statutory or regulatory authority.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that the coastal zone is rich in a variety of natural, commercial, recreational, ecological, industrial, and aesthetic resources of immediate and potential value to the present and future well-being of the residents of this state which will be irretrievably lost or damaged if not properly managed. The participation by citizens of the state is an important factor in developing, adopting, amending, and implementing a program for management of the coastal zone, and management of the state’s coastal zone requires a highly coordinated effort among state, regional, and local officials and agencies.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The state coastal zone management program shall contain each of the program elements necessary to comply with the requirements of the Coastal Zone Management Act, specifically delineating the role of state, regional, and local agencies in implementing the program; and it shall provide that the appeal of any regulatory decision, other than those appeals provided for by existing law, shall be to the Governor and Cabinet.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature recognizes that land acquisition has great potential to support the state’s coastal management and regulatory efforts. Removing coastal properties from the pool of developable acreage reduces the adverse land use and environmental impacts the state coastal zone management program is attempting to eliminate or diminish, while at the same time minimizing public expenditures and reducing risk to life and property in storm-prone coastal areas. To this end, the acquisition of coastal lands shall be an important component of the coastal zone management program.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 78-287; s. 5, ch. 84-257; s. 3, ch. 92-276; s. 59, ch. 93-206; s. 3, ch. 2002-275.</History></Section>
