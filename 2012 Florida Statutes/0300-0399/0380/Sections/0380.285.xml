		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Division of Historical Resources of the Department of State shall undertake a study of the lighthouses in the state. The study must determine the location, ownership, condition, and historical significance of all lighthouses in the state and ensure that all historically significant lighthouses are nominated for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places. The study must assess the condition and restoration needs of historic lighthouses and develop plans for appropriate future public access and use. The Division of Historical Resources shall take a leadership role in implementing plans to stabilize lighthouses and associated structures and to preserve and protect them from future deterioration. When possible, the lighthouses and associated buildings should be made available to the public for educational and recreational purposes. The Department of State shall request in its annual legislative budget requests funding necessary to carry out the duties and responsibilities specified in this act. Funds for the rehabilitation of lighthouses should be allocated through matching grants-in-aid to state and local government agencies and to nonprofit organizations. The Department of Environmental Protection may assist the Division of Historical Resources in projects to accomplish the goals and activities described in this section.</Text>
