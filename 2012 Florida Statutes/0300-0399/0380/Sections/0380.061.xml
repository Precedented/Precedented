			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">There is hereby created the Florida Quality Developments program. The intent of this program is to encourage development which has been thoughtfully planned to take into consideration protection of Florida’s natural amenities, the cost to local government of providing services to a growing community, and the high quality of life Floridians desire. It is further intended that the developer be provided, through a cooperative and coordinated effort, an expeditious and timely review by all agencies with jurisdiction over the project of his or her proposed development.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Developments that may be designated as Florida Quality Developments are those developments which are above 80 percent of any numerical thresholds in the guidelines and standards for development-of-regional-impact review pursuant to s. 380.06.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At any time prior to the issuance of the Florida Quality Development development order, the developer of a proposed Florida Quality Development shall have the right to withdraw the proposed project from consideration as a Florida Quality Development.
