The authority shall also ensure that all reasonable costs to the state and substantially affected local governments and utilities related to the private transportation facility are borne by the private entity for transportation facilities that are owned by private entities. For projects on the State Highway System or that provide increased mobility on the State Highway System, the department may use state resources to participate in funding and financing the project as provided for under the department’s enabling legislation.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The authority may request proposals and receive unsolicited proposals for public-private transportation projects and, upon receipt of any unsolicited proposal or determination to issue a request for proposals, must publish a notice in the Florida Administrative Weekly and a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the proposed project is located at least once a week for 2 weeks requesting proposals or, if an unsolicited proposal was received, stating that it has received the proposal and will accept, for 60 days after the initial date of publication, other proposals for the same project purpose. A copy of the notice must be mailed to each local government in the affected areas. After the public notification period has expired, the authority shall rank the proposals in order of preference. In ranking the proposals, the authority shall consider professional qualifications, general business terms, innovative engineering or cost-reduction terms, finance plans, and the need for state funds to deliver the proposal. If the authority is not satisfied with the results of the negotiations, it may, at its sole discretion, terminate negotiations with the proposer. If these negotiations are unsuccessful, the authority may go to the second and lower-ranked firms, in order, using the same procedure. If only one proposal is received, the authority may negotiate in good faith and, if it is not satisfied with the results, may, at its sole discretion, terminate negotiations with the proposer. Notwithstanding this subsection, the authority may, at its discretion, reject all proposals at any point in the process up to completion of a contract with the proposer. Any person submitting an unsolicited proposal shall submit with the proposal the sum of $25,000 to the authority to be applied by the authority to its costs of review and analysis of the proposal, and such person shall remain liable for any additional costs and expenses of the authority incurred for the review and analysis.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Agreements entered into pursuant to this section may authorize the authority or the private project owner, lessee, or operator to impose, collect, and enforce tolls or fares for the use of the transportation facility.
