Such bonds are payable exclusively from revenues pledged for their payment. All such bonds shall contain a statement on their face that the state is not obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon, except from the revenues pledged for their payment, and that the faith and credit of the state is not pledged to the payment of the principal or interest of such bonds. The issuance of turnpike revenue bonds under the provisions of ss. 338.22-338.241 does not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatsoever, or to make any appropriation for their payment. Except as provided in ss. 338.223, 338.2275, and 339.65, state funds may not be used on any turnpike project or to pay the principal or interest of any bonds issued to finance or refinance any portion of the turnpike system, and all such bonds shall contain a statement on their face to this effect.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 13, ch. 28128, 1953; s. 194, ch. 84-309; s. 7, ch. 88-286; s. 15, ch. 90-136; s. 129, ch. 99-13; s. 94, ch. 99-385; s. 49, ch. 2012-174.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 340.13.</Text></Note></Section>
