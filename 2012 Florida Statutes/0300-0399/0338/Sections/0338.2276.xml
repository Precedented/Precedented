If funding is insufficient to construct part C, it is the intent of the Legislature that such project be given priority as a project financed from subsequent issuances of turnpike revenue bonds approved by the Legislature; however, such priority consideration is contingent on the project’s meeting all economic feasibility requirements and upon the project’s being financed without the use of capitalized interest.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 13, ch. 90-136; s. 47, ch. 95-257; s. 21, ch. 97-280.</History></Section>
