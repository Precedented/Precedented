Further, any court or the office of the clerk of any court of this state which is electronically connected by a terminal device to the computer data center of the department may use as evidence in any case the information obtained by this device from the records of the department without need of such certification; however, if a genuine issue as to the authenticity of such information is raised by a party or by the court, the court may require that a record certified by the department be submitted for admission into evidence. For computer copies generated by a terminal device of a court or clerk of court, entry in a driver’s record that the notice required by s. 322.251 was given constitutes sufficient evidence that such notice was given.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 63-371; s. 1, ch. 67-305; ss. 24, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 2, ch. 81-34; s. 20, ch. 83-218; s. 30, ch. 91-221; s. 288, ch. 99-248; s. 35, ch. 2009-71.</History></Section>
