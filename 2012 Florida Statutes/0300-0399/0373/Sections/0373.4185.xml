The list may include information concerning any associated testing to determine compliance with state permitting standards and information on application rates and methods. Publication of this list is not a rule under chapter 120. This section does not prevent an entity from proposing or the department from approving the use of a flocculant that is not on the department’s list subject to the entity providing the necessary documentation required by the department to ensure that the use of the flocculant will not cause harm to the water resources of the state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 2008-40.</History></Section>
