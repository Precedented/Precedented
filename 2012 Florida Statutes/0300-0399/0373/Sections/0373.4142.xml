Such inapplicability of state water quality standards shall be limited to that part of the stormwater management system located upstream of a manmade water control structure permitted, or approved under a noticed exemption, to retain or detain stormwater runoff in order to provide treatment of the stormwater. The additional use of such a stormwater management system for flood attenuation or irrigation shall not divest the system of the benefits of this exemption. This section shall not affect the authority of the department and water management districts to require reasonable assurance that the water quality within such stormwater management systems will not adversely impact public health, fish and wildlife, or adjacent waters.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 94-122; s. 2, ch. 2007-191.</History></Section>
