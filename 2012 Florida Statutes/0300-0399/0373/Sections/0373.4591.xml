		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature encourages public-private partnerships to accomplish water storage and water quality improvements on private agricultural lands. When an agreement is entered into between a water management district or the department and a private landowner to establish such a partnership, a baseline condition determining the extent of wetlands and other surface waters on the property shall be established and documented in the agreement before improvements are constructed. The determination for the baseline condition shall be conducted using the methods set forth in the rules adopted pursuant to s. 373.421. The baseline condition documented in the agreement shall be considered the extent of wetlands and other surface waters on the property for the purpose of regulation under this chapter for the duration of the agreement and after its expiration.</Text>
