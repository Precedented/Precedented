		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature believes it is in the public interest that all water management districts created pursuant to s. 373.069 own, acquire, develop, construct, operate, and manage public information systems. Public information systems may be located on property owned by the water management district, upon terms and conditions approved by the water management district, and must display messages to the general public concerning water management services, activities, events, and sponsors, as well as other public service announcements, including watering restrictions, severe weather reports, amber alerts, and other essential information needed by the public. Local government review or approval is not required for a public information system owned or hereafter acquired, developed, or constructed by the water management district on its own property. A public information system is exempt from the requirements of chapter 479. Water management district funds may not be used to pay the cost to acquire, develop, construct, operate, or manage a public information system. Any necessary funds for a public information system shall be paid for and collected from private sponsors who may display commercial messages.</Text>
