The department or the governing board must issue its permit conditioned upon the securing of the necessary consent or approvals by the applicant. Once the department has adopted rules under s. 373.427 for concurrent review of applications for permits under this part and proprietary authorizations under chapters 253 and 258 to use submerged lands, the permitting conditions required under this section cease to apply to those applications. If the approval or authorization of the board is required, the applicant may not commence any excavation, construction, or other activity until the approval or authorization has been issued.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 32, ch. 93-213; s. 503, ch. 94-356.</History></Section>
