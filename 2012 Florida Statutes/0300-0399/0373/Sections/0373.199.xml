			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Over the years, the Legislature has created numerous programs and funded several initiatives intended to restore, conserve, protect, and manage Florida’s water resources and the lands and ecosystems associated with them. Although these programs and initiatives have yielded individual successes, the overall quality of Florida’s water resources continues to degrade; natural systems associated with surface waters continue to be altered or have not been restored to a fully functioning level; and sufficient quantities of water for current and future reasonable beneficial uses and for natural systems remain in doubt.</Text>
