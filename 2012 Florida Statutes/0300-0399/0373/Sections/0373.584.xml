In anticipation of the sale of such revenue bonds, the district may issue negotiable bond anticipation notes and may renew the same from time to time; but the maximum maturity of any such note, including renewals thereof, shall not exceed 5 years from the date of issue of the original note. Such notes shall be paid from the revenues hereinafter provided or from the proceeds of sale of the revenue bonds of such district in anticipation of which they were issued. The notes shall be issued in the same manner as the revenue bonds.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Revenues derived by the district from the Water Management Lands Trust Fund as provided in s. 373.59 or any other revenues of the district may be pledged to the payment of such revenue bonds; however, the ad valorem taxing powers of the district may not be pledged to the payment of such revenue bonds without prior compliance with the requirements of the State Constitution as to the affirmative vote of the electors of the district and with the requirements of s. 373.563, and bonds payable from the Water Management Lands Trust Fund shall be issued solely for the purposes set forth in s. 373.59. Revenue bonds and notes shall be, and shall be deemed to be, for all purposes, negotiable instruments, subject only to the provisions of the revenue bonds and notes for registration. The powers and authority of districts to issue revenue bonds, including, but not limited to, bonds to finance a stormwater management system as defined by s. 373.403, and to enter into contracts incidental thereto, and to do all things necessary and desirable in connection with the issuance of revenue bonds, shall be coextensive with the powers and authority of municipalities to issue bonds under state law. The provisions of this section constitute full and complete authority for the issuance of revenue bonds and shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The revenue bonds may be issued as serial bonds or as term bonds; or the district, in its discretion, may issue bonds of both types. The revenue bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the governing board and shall bear such date or dates; mature at such time or times, not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates; bear interest at such rate or rates; be payable at such time or times; be in such denominations; be in such form; carry such registration privileges; be executed in such manner; be payable in lawful money of the United States at such place or places; and be subject to such terms of redemption, including redemption prior to maturity, as such resolution or resolutions may provide. If any officer whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he or she had remained in office until the delivery. The revenue bonds or notes may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the governing board shall determine. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, the district may issue interim receipts or certificates which shall be exchanged for such definitive bonds.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As used in this section:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Bonds” means bonds, debentures, notes, certificates of indebtedness, certificates of participation, mortgage certificates, or other obligations or evidences of indebtedness of any type or character.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Project” means a governmental undertaking approved by the governing body of a water management district and includes all property rights, easements, and franchises relating thereto and deemed necessary or convenient for the construction, acquisition, or operation thereof, and embraces any capital expenditure which the governing body of a water management district shall deem to be made for a public purpose, including the refunding of any bonded indebtedness which may be outstanding on any existing project.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Revenue bonds” means bonds of a water management district to the payment of which the full faith and credit and power to levy ad valorem taxes are not pledged.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The total annual debt service for bonds issued pursuant to this section and s. 373.563 may not exceed 20 percent of the annual ad valorem tax revenues of the water management district, unless approved by the Joint Legislative Budget Commission.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Joint Legislative Budget Commission is authorized to review the financial soundness of a water management district and determine whether bonds may be issued by a water management district in excess of the limitation provided in paragraph (a).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A water management district may not take any action regarding the issuance of bonds in excess of the limitation of paragraph (a) without prior approval of the Joint Legislative Budget Commission pursuant to joint rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Bonds issued and outstanding before January 1, 2009, are exempt from this subsection and shall not be included in the calculation of the limitation of paragraph (a).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This subsection does not affect the validity or enforceability of outstanding revenue bonds.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 85-347; s. 6, ch. 91-80; s. 613, ch. 95-148; s. 13, ch. 2009-243.</History></Section>
