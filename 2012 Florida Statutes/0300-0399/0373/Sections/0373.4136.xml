			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">MITIGATION BANK PERMITS.<EmDash />The department and the water management districts may require permits to authorize the establishment and use of mitigation banks. A mitigation bank permit shall also constitute authorization to construct, alter, operate, maintain, abandon, or remove any surface water management system necessary to establish and operate the mitigation bank. To obtain a mitigation bank permit, the applicant must provide reasonable assurance that:</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">MITIGATION BANK PHASES.<EmDash />A mitigation bank may be established and operated in phases if each phase independently meets the requirements for the establishment and operation of a mitigation bank. The number of mitigation credits assigned to a phase of a mitigation bank may be less than would be assigned to that phase upon completion of all phases of the mitigation bank. In such case, the department or water management districts shall increase the number of mitigation credits awarded to subsequent phases of the mitigation bank.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">ADDITION OF LANDS.<EmDash />The department or water management district shall authorize the addition of land to a permitted mitigation bank when it is appropriate to do so and the addition of the land results in an increase in the ecological value of the existing mitigation bank. Any such addition shall be accomplished through a modification to the permit which reflects the corresponding increase in the total number of mitigation credits assigned to the bank.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">MITIGATION CREDITS.<EmDash />After evaluating the information submitted by the applicant for a mitigation bank permit and assessing the proposed mitigation bank pursuant to the criteria in this section, the department or water management district shall award a number of mitigation credits to a proposed mitigation bank or phase of such mitigation bank. An entity establishing and operating a mitigation bank may apply to modify the mitigation bank permit to seek the award of additional mitigation credits if the mitigation bank results in an additional increase in ecological value over the value contemplated at the time of the original permit issuance, or the most recent modification thereto involving the number of credits awarded. The number of credits awarded shall be based on the degree of improvement in ecological value expected to result from the establishment and operation of the mitigation bank as determined using a functional assessment methodology. In determining the degree of improvement in ecological value, each of the following factors, at a minimum, shall be evaluated:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The extent to which target hydrologic regimes can be achieved and maintained.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">SCHEDULE FOR CREDIT RELEASE.<EmDash />After awarding mitigation credits to a mitigation bank, the department or the water management district shall set forth a schedule for the release of those credits in the mitigation bank permit. A mitigation credit that has been released may be sold or used to offset adverse impacts from an activity regulated under this part.</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department or the water management district shall allow a portion of the mitigation credits awarded to a mitigation bank to be released for sale or use prior to meeting all of the performance criteria specified in the mitigation bank permit.

			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The number of credits and schedule for release shall be determined by the department or water management district based upon the performance criteria for the mitigation bank and the success criteria for each mitigation activity. The release schedule for a specific mitigation bank or phase thereof shall be related to the actions required to implement the bank, such as site protection, site preparation, earthwork, removal of wastes, planting, removal or control of nuisance and exotic species, installation of structures, and annual monitoring and management requirements for success. In determining the specific release schedule for a bank, the department or water management district shall consider, at a minimum, the following factors:</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">MITIGATION SERVICE AREA.<EmDash />The department or water management district shall establish a mitigation service area for each mitigation bank permit. The department or water management district shall notify and consider comments received on the proposed mitigation service area from each local government within the proposed mitigation service area. Except as provided herein, mitigation credits may be withdrawn and used only to offset adverse impacts in the mitigation service area. The boundaries of the mitigation service area shall depend upon the geographic area where the mitigation bank could reasonably be expected to offset adverse impacts. Mitigation service areas may overlap, and mitigation service areas for two or more mitigation banks may be approved for a regional watershed.</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In determining the boundaries of the mitigation service area, the department or the water management district shall consider the characteristics, size, and location of the mitigation bank and, at a minimum, the extent to which the mitigation bank:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Contributes to a regional integrated ecological network;</Text>

				</SubParagraph>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department and water management districts shall use regional watersheds to guide the establishment of mitigation service areas. Drainage basins established pursuant to s. 373.414(8) may be used as regional watersheds when they are established based on the hydrological or ecological characteristics of the basin. A mitigation service area may extend beyond the regional watershed in which the bank is located into all or part of other regional watersheds when the mitigation bank has the ability to offset adverse impacts outside that regional watershed. Similarly, a mitigation service area may be smaller than the regional watershed in which the mitigation bank is located when adverse impacts throughout the regional watershed cannot reasonably be expected to be offset by the mitigation bank because of local ecological or hydrological conditions.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Once a mitigation bank service area has been established by the department or a water management district for a mitigation bank, such service area shall be accepted by all water management districts, local governments, and the department.</Text>
