As used in this section, the term “service area” means the fewest number of zip codes that account for 75 percent of the hospital’s discharges for the most recent 5-year period, based on information available from the hospital inpatient discharge database in the Florida Center for Health Information and Policy Analysis at the Agency for Health Care Administration.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 2003-258; s. 9, ch. 2006-261.</History></Section>
