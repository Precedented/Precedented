Public health programs and physicians depend on rural hospitals to meet many of their medical needs. Rural hospitals are usually the only source of emergency medical care in rural areas for life-threatening situations and play a crucial role in attracting physicians to rural areas. The Legislature deems the benefits derived from these features to be truly significant as rural counties with hospitals have lower accidental death rates and lower incidence of low birth weight than rural counties without hospitals. In addition, rural hospitals enhance their communities beyond the scope of health care as they are among the largest employers in rural areas and substantially foster economic development and growth. For these reasons, the Legislature finds that rural hospitals are widely viewed as integral to the welfare of rural communities. However, the rural health care system is experiencing significant instability as the financial viability of many of these hospitals is threatened. The Legislature finds that sharply declining occupancy rates, increasing dependence on Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements, liability concerns, frequent changes in ownership, high levels of bad debt, greater competition on more sophisticated levels with urban hospitals, and physician and personnel staffing problems threaten the existence of some rural hospitals.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">It is the intent of the Legislature to ease the burdens experienced by rural hospitals in personnel staffing by:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Providing financial incentives under the Medical Education Tuition Reimbursement Program in order to increase the number of primary care physicians and nurses in rural areas; and</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Requiring a study of problems unique to rural hospitals generated by existing licensure and certification requirements for allied health care practitioners in the state.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In addition, it is the intent of the Legislature to ease the severe financial constraints being experienced by some rural hospitals by extending Medicaid reimbursements to rural hospital swing-beds and establishing the full utilization, when feasible, of rural hospital services by departmental primary care programs and programs serving the elderly citizens of the state.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Furthermore, the Legislature encourages the department to actively foster the provision of health care services in rural areas and serve as a catalyst for improved health services to citizens in rural areas of the state.
