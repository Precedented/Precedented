The service may provide monitoring by posting on a vehicle a placard that shows a toll-free telephone number and a unique identifying number and includes a request to members of the public to call the toll-free telephone number to report inappropriate driving practices. The service shall enter into a contract with the parents or guardians under which the service shall timely forward to the parents or guardians all reports of inappropriate driving practices by the minor child.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A youthful driver monitoring service may register with the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The registration must consist of a narrative description of the services offered by the youthful driver monitoring service, the name of the manager in charge of the service, the address of the service, and the telephone number of the service. Registration under this subsection remains valid indefinitely, but it is the responsibility of the youthful driver monitoring service to timely file a revised registration statement to reflect any changes in the required information. If the department determines that the youthful driver monitoring service is not providing the services described in the narrative statement, the department may suspend the registration; however, the department must reinstate the registration when the service files a revised statement that reflects its actual practices.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 22, ch. 2006-290.</History></Section>
