			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">DEFINITIONS.<EmDash />The following words, terms, and phrases when used in this section have the meanings respectively ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Department” means the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Motor vehicle” means any motor vehicle of the type and kind required to be registered and titled under chapter 319 and this chapter, except a recreational vehicle, moped, motorcycle powered by a motor with a displacement of 50 cubic centimeters or less, or mobile home.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Motor vehicle dealer” means any person engaged in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles or offering or displaying motor vehicles for sale at wholesale or retail, or who may service and repair motor vehicles pursuant to an agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1). Any person who buys, sells, or deals in three or more motor vehicles in any 12-month period or who offers or displays for sale three or more motor vehicles in any 12-month period shall be prima facie presumed to be engaged in such business. The terms “selling” and “sale” include lease-purchase transactions. A motor vehicle dealer may, at retail or wholesale, sell a recreational vehicle as described in s. 320.01(1)(b)1.-6. and 8., acquired in exchange for the sale of a motor vehicle, provided such acquisition is incidental to the principal business of being a motor vehicle dealer. However, a motor vehicle dealer may not buy a recreational vehicle for the purpose of resale unless licensed as a recreational vehicle dealer pursuant to s. 320.771. A motor vehicle dealer may apply for a certificate of title to a motor vehicle required to be registered under s. 320.08(2)(b), (c), and (d), using a manufacturer’s statement of origin as permitted by s. 319.23(1), only if such dealer is authorized by a franchised agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1), to buy, sell, or deal in such vehicle and is authorized by such agreement to perform delivery and preparation obligations and warranty defect adjustments on the motor vehicle; provided this limitation shall not apply to recreational vehicles, van conversions, or any other motor vehicle manufactured on a truck chassis. The transfer of a motor vehicle by a dealer not meeting these qualifications shall be titled as a used vehicle. The classifications of motor vehicle dealers are defined as follows:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Franchised motor vehicle dealer” means any person who engages in the business of repairing, servicing, buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles pursuant to an agreement as defined in s. 320.60(1).</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Independent motor vehicle dealer” means any person other than a franchised or wholesale motor vehicle dealer who engages in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles, and who may service and repair motor vehicles.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Wholesale motor vehicle dealer” means any person who engages exclusively in the business of buying, selling, or dealing in motor vehicles at wholesale or with motor vehicle auctions. Such person shall be licensed to do business in this state, shall not sell or auction a vehicle to any person who is not a licensed dealer, and shall not have the privilege of the use of dealer license plates. Any person who buys, sells, or deals in motor vehicles at wholesale or with motor vehicle auctions on behalf of a licensed motor vehicle dealer and as a bona fide employee of such licensed motor vehicle dealer is not required to be licensed as a wholesale motor vehicle dealer. In such cases it shall be prima facie presumed that a bona fide employer-employee relationship exists. A wholesale motor vehicle dealer shall be exempt from the display provisions of this section but shall maintain an office wherein records are kept in order that those records may be inspected.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="4">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Motor vehicle auction” means any person offering motor vehicles or recreational vehicles for sale to the highest bidder where buyers are licensed motor vehicle dealers. Such person shall not sell a vehicle to anyone other than a licensed motor vehicle dealer.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="5">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Salvage motor vehicle dealer” means any person who engages in the business of acquiring salvaged or wrecked motor vehicles for the purpose of reselling them and their parts.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">The term “motor vehicle dealer” does not include persons not engaged in the purchase or sale of motor vehicles as a business who are disposing of vehicles acquired for their own use or for use in their business or acquired by foreclosure or by operation of law, provided such vehicles are acquired and sold in good faith and not for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this law; persons engaged in the business of manufacturing, selling, or offering or displaying for sale at wholesale or retail no more than 25 trailers in a 12-month period; public officers while performing their official duties; receivers; trustees, administrators, executors, guardians, or other persons appointed by, or acting under the judgment or order of, any court; banks, finance companies, or other loan agencies that acquire motor vehicles as an incident to their regular business; motor vehicle brokers; and motor vehicle rental and leasing companies that sell motor vehicles to motor vehicle dealers licensed under this section. Vehicles owned under circumstances described in this paragraph may be disposed of at retail, wholesale, or auction, unless otherwise restricted. A manufacturer of fire trucks, ambulances, or school buses may sell such vehicles directly to governmental agencies or to persons who contract to perform or provide firefighting, ambulance, or school transportation services exclusively to governmental agencies without processing such sales through dealers if such fire trucks, ambulances, school buses, or similar vehicles are not presently available through motor vehicle dealers licensed by the department.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Motor vehicle broker” means any person engaged in the business of offering to procure or procuring motor vehicles for the general public, or who holds himself or herself out through solicitation, advertisement, or otherwise as one who offers to procure or procures motor vehicles for the general public, and who does not store, display, or take ownership of any vehicles for the purpose of selling such vehicles.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">LICENSE REQUIRED.<EmDash />No person shall engage in business as, serve in the capacity of, or act as a motor vehicle dealer in this state without first obtaining a license therefor in the appropriate classification as provided in this section. With the exception of transactions with motor vehicle auctions, no person other than a licensed motor vehicle dealer may advertise for sale any motor vehicle belonging to another party unless as a direct result of a bona fide legal proceeding, court order, settlement of an estate, or by operation of law. However, owners of motor vehicles titled in their names may advertise and offer vehicles for sale on their own behalf. It shall be unlawful for a licensed motor vehicle dealer to allow any person other than a bona fide employee to use the motor vehicle dealer license for the purpose of acting in the capacity of or conducting motor vehicle sales transactions as a motor vehicle dealer. Any person selling or offering a motor vehicle for sale in violation of the licensing requirements of this subsection, or who misrepresents to any person its relationship with any manufacturer, importer, or distributor, in addition to the penalties provided herein, shall be deemed guilty of an unfair and deceptive trade practice as defined in part II of chapter 501 and shall be subject to the provisions of subsections (8) and (9).</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">APPLICATION AND FEE.<EmDash />The application for the license shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the department and shall be subject to such rules with respect thereto as may be so prescribed by it. Such application shall be verified by oath or affirmation and shall contain a full statement of the name and birth date of the person or persons applying therefor; the name of the firm or copartnership, with the names and places of residence of all members thereof, if such applicant is a firm or copartnership; the names and places of residence of the principal officers, if the applicant is a body corporate or other artificial body; the name of the state under whose laws the corporation is organized; the present and former place or places of residence of the applicant; and prior business in which the applicant has been engaged and the location thereof. Such application shall describe the exact location of the place of business and shall state whether the place of business is owned by the applicant and when acquired, or, if leased, a true copy of the lease shall be attached to the application. The applicant shall certify that the location provides an adequately equipped office and is not a residence; that the location affords sufficient unoccupied space upon and within which adequately to store all motor vehicles offered and displayed for sale; and that the location is a suitable place where the applicant can in good faith carry on such business and keep and maintain books, records, and files necessary to conduct such business, which shall be available at all reasonable hours to inspection by the department or any of its inspectors or other employees. The applicant shall certify that the business of a motor vehicle dealer is the principal business which shall be conducted at that location. The application shall contain a statement that the applicant is either franchised by a manufacturer of motor vehicles, in which case the name of each motor vehicle that the applicant is franchised to sell shall be included, or an independent (nonfranchised) motor vehicle dealer. The application shall contain other relevant information as may be required by the department, including evidence that the applicant is insured under a garage liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance policy coupled with a business automobile policy, which shall include, at a minimum, $25,000 combined single-limit liability coverage including bodily injury and property damage protection and $10,000 personal injury protection. However, a salvage motor vehicle dealer as defined in subparagraph (1)(c)5. is exempt from the requirements for garage liability insurance and personal injury protection insurance on those vehicles that cannot be legally operated on roads, highways, or streets in this state. Franchise dealers must submit a garage liability insurance policy, and all other dealers must submit a garage liability insurance policy or a general liability insurance policy coupled with a business automobile policy. Such policy shall be for the license period, and evidence of a new or continued policy shall be delivered to the department at the beginning of each license period. Upon making initial application, the applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $300 in addition to any other fees now required by law. Upon making a subsequent renewal application, the applicant shall pay to the department a fee of $75 in addition to any other fees now required by law. Upon making an application for a change of location, the person shall pay a fee of $50 in addition to any other fees now required by law. The department shall, in the case of every application for initial licensure, verify whether certain facts set forth in the application are true. Each applicant, general partner in the case of a partnership, or corporate officer and director in the case of a corporate applicant, must file a set of fingerprints with the department for the purpose of determining any prior criminal record or any outstanding warrants. The department shall submit the fingerprints to the Department of Law Enforcement for state processing and forwarding to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for federal processing. The actual cost of state and federal processing shall be borne by the applicant and is in addition to the fee for licensure. The department may issue a license to an applicant pending the results of the fingerprint investigation, which license is fully revocable if the department subsequently determines that any facts set forth in the application are not true or correctly represented.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">LICENSE CERTIFICATE.<EmDash /></Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A license certificate shall be issued by the department in accordance with such application when the application is regular in form and in compliance with the provisions of this section. The license certificate may be in the form of a document or a computerized card as determined by the department. The actual cost of each original, additional, or replacement computerized card shall be borne by the licensee and is in addition to the fee for licensure. Such license, when so issued, entitles the licensee to carry on and conduct the business of a motor vehicle dealer. Each license issued to a franchise motor vehicle dealer expires annually on December 31 unless revoked or suspended prior to that date. Each license issued to an independent or wholesale dealer or auction expires annually on April 30 unless revoked or suspended prior to that date. Not less than 60 days prior to the license expiration date, the department shall deliver or mail to each licensee the necessary renewal forms. Each independent dealer shall certify that the dealer (owner, partner, officer, or director of the licensee, or a full-time employee of the licensee that holds a responsible management-level position) has completed 8 hours of continuing education prior to filing the renewal forms with the department. Such certification shall be filed once every 2 years. The continuing education shall include at least 2 hours of legal or legislative issues, 1 hour of department issues, and 5 hours of relevant motor vehicle industry topics. Continuing education shall be provided by dealer schools licensed under paragraph (b) either in a classroom setting or by correspondence. Such schools shall provide certificates of completion to the department and the customer which shall be filed with the license renewal form, and such schools may charge a fee for providing continuing education. Any licensee who does not file his or her application and fees and any other requisite documents, as required by law, with the department at least 30 days prior to the license expiration date shall cease to engage in business as a motor vehicle dealer on the license expiration date. A renewal filed with the department within 45 days after the expiration date shall be accompanied by a delinquent fee of $100. Thereafter, a new application is required, accompanied by the initial license fee. A license certificate duly issued by the department may be modified by endorsement to show a change in the name of the licensee, provided, as shown by affidavit of the licensee, the majority ownership interest of the licensee has not changed or the name of the person appearing as franchisee on the sales and service agreement has not changed. Modification of a license certificate to show any name change as herein provided shall not require initial licensure or reissuance of dealer tags; however, any dealer obtaining a name change shall transact all business in and be properly identified by that name. All documents relative to licensure shall reflect the new name. In the case of a franchise dealer, the name change shall be approved by the manufacturer, distributor, or importer. A licensee applying for a name change endorsement shall pay a fee of $25 which fee shall apply to the change in the name of a main location and all additional locations licensed under the provisions of subsection (5). Each initial license application received by the department shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant, or one or more of his or her designated employees, has attended a training and information seminar conducted by a licensed motor vehicle dealer training school. Any applicant for a new franchised motor vehicle dealer license who has held a valid franchised motor vehicle dealer license continuously for the past 2 years and who remains in good standing with the department is exempt from the prelicensing training requirement. Such seminar shall include, but is not limited to, statutory dealer requirements, which requirements include required bookkeeping and recordkeeping procedures, requirements for the collection of sales and use taxes, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. No seminar may exceed 8 hours in length.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each initial license application received by the department for licensure under subparagraph (1)(c)2. shall be accompanied by verification that, within the preceding 6 months, the applicant (owner, partner, officer, or director of the applicant, or a full-time employee of the applicant that holds a responsible management-level position) has successfully completed training conducted by a licensed motor vehicle dealer training school. Such training must include training in titling and registration of motor vehicles, laws relating to unfair and deceptive trade practices, laws relating to financing with regard to buy-here, pay-here operations, and such other information that in the opinion of the department will promote good business practices. Successful completion of this training shall be determined by examination administered at the end of the course and attendance of no less than 90 percent of the total hours required by such school. Any applicant who had held a valid motor vehicle dealer’s license continuously within the past 2 years and who remains in good standing with the department is exempt from the prelicensing requirements of this section. The department shall have the authority to adopt any rule necessary for establishing the training curriculum; length of training, which shall not exceed 8 hours for required department topics and shall not exceed an additional 24 hours for topics related to other regulatory agencies’ instructor qualifications; and any other requirements under this section. The curriculum for other subjects shall be approved by any and all other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over specific subject matters; however, the overall administration of the licensing of these dealer schools and their instructors shall remain with the department. Such schools are authorized to charge a fee.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE.<EmDash />Any person licensed hereunder shall obtain a supplemental license for each permanent additional place or places of business not contiguous to the premises for which the original license is issued, on a form to be furnished by the department, and upon payment of a fee of $50 for each such additional location. Upon making renewal applications for such supplemental licenses, such applicant shall pay $50 for each additional location. A supplemental license authorizing off-premises sales shall be issued, at no charge to the dealer, for a period not to exceed 10 consecutive calendar days. To obtain such a temporary supplemental license for off-premises sales, the applicant must be a licensed dealer; must notify the applicable local department office of the specific dates and location for which such license is requested, display a sign at the licensed location clearly identifying the dealer, and provide staff to work at the temporary location for the duration of the off-premises sale; must meet any local government permitting requirements; and must have permission of the property owner to sell at that location. In the case of an off-premises sale by a motor vehicle dealer licensed under subparagraph (1)(c)1. for the sale of new motor vehicles, the applicant must also include documentation notifying the applicable licensee licensed under s. 320.61 of the intent to engage in an off-premises sale 5 working days prior to the date of the off-premises sale. The licensee shall either approve or disapprove of the off-premises sale within 2 working days after receiving notice; otherwise, it will be deemed approved. This section does not apply to a nonselling motor vehicle show or public display of new motor vehicles.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY LICENSEE.<EmDash />Every licensee shall keep a book or record in either paper or electronic form as prescribed or approved by the department for a period of 5 years, in which the licensee shall keep a record of the purchase, sale, or exchange, or receipt for the purpose of sale, of any motor vehicle, the date upon which any temporary tag was issued, the date of title transfer, and a description of such motor vehicle together with the name and address of the seller, the purchaser, and the alleged owner or other person from whom such motor vehicle was purchased or received or to whom it was sold or delivered, as the case may be. Such description shall include the identification or engine number, maker’s number, if any, chassis number, if any, and such other numbers or identification marks as may be thereon and shall also include a statement that a number has been obliterated, defaced, or changed, if such is the fact. When a licensee chooses to maintain electronic records, the original paper documents may be destroyed after the licensee successfully transfers title and registration to the purchaser as required by chapter 319 for any purchaser who titles and registers the motor vehicle in this state. In the case of a sale to a purchaser who will title and register the motor vehicle in another state or country, the licensee may destroy the original paper documents after successfully delivering a lawfully reassigned title or manufacturer’s certificate or statement of origin to the purchaser and after producing electronic images of all documents related to the sale.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">CERTIFICATE OF TITLE REQUIRED.<EmDash />For each used motor vehicle in the possession of a licensee and offered for sale by him or her, the licensee either shall have in his or her possession or control a duly assigned certificate of title from the owner in accordance with the provisions of chapter 319, from the time when the motor vehicle is delivered to the licensee and offered for sale by him or her until it has been disposed of by the licensee, or shall have reasonable indicia of ownership or right of possession, or shall have made proper application for a certificate of title or duplicate certificate of title in accordance with the provisions of chapter 319. A motor vehicle dealer may not sell or offer for sale a vehicle in his or her possession unless the dealer satisfies the requirements of this subsection. Reasonable indicia of ownership shall include a duly assigned certificate of title; in the case of a new motor vehicle, a manufacturer’s certificate of origin issued to or reassigned to the dealer; a consignment contract between the owner and the dealer along with a secure power of attorney from the owner to the dealer authorizing the dealer to apply for a duplicate certificate of title and assign the title on behalf of the owner; a court order awarding title to the vehicle to the dealer; a salvage certificate of title; a photocopy of a duly assigned certificate of title being held by a financial institution as collateral for a business loan of money to the dealer (“floor plan”); a copy of a canceled check or other documentation evidencing that an outstanding lien on a vehicle taken in trade by a licensed dealer has been satisfied and that the certificate of title will be, but has not yet been, received by the dealer; a vehicle purchase order or installment contract for a specific vehicle identifying that vehicle as a trade-in on a replacement vehicle; or a duly executed odometer disclosure statement as required by Title IV of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972 (Pub.
