			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any resident owner of a motor vehicle or mobile home that has been destroyed or permanently removed from the state shall, upon application to the department and surrender of the license plate or mobile home sticker issued for such vehicle, be entitled to a credit to apply to registration of any other vehicle in the name of the owner, if the amount is $3 or more, for the unexpired period of the license. However, if the license plate surrendered is a “for-hire” license plate, the amount of credit may not be more than one-half of the annual license tax amount. A credit is not valid after the expiration date of the license plate which is current on the date of the credit, as provided in s. 320.07.</Text>
