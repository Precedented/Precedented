				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Until a child’s first birthday, the child’s given name or surname may be amended upon receipt of the fees prescribed in s. 382.0255 and an affidavit signed by each parent named on the original birth certificate or by the registrant’s guardian. If both parents are named on the certificate but both are not willing or available to sign the affidavit, the registrant’s name may only be amended by court order.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon written request and receipt of an affidavit, a notarized voluntary acknowledgment of paternity signed by the mother and father acknowledging the paternity of a registrant born out of wedlock, or a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that is witnessed by two individuals and signed under penalty of perjury as specified by s. 92.525(2), together with sufficient information to identify the original certificate of live birth, the department shall prepare a new birth certificate, which shall bear the same file number as the original birth certificate. The names and identifying information of the parents shall be entered as of the date of the registrant’s birth. The surname of the registrant may be changed from that shown on the original birth certificate at the request of the mother and father of the registrant, or the registrant if of legal age. If the mother and father marry each other at any time after the registrant’s birth, the department shall, upon receipt of a marriage license that identifies the registrant, or upon the request of the mother and father or registrant if of legal age and proof of the marriage, amend the certificate with regard to the parents’ marital status as though the parents were married at the time of birth. The department shall substitute the new certificate of birth for the original certificate on file. All copies of the original certificate of live birth in the custody of a local registrar or other state custodian of vital records shall be forwarded to the State Registrar. Thereafter, when a certified copy of the certificate of birth or portion thereof is issued, it shall be a copy of the new certificate of birth or portion thereof, except when a court order requires issuance of a certified copy of the original certificate of birth. Except for a birth certificate on which a father is listed pursuant to an affidavit, a notarized voluntary acknowledgment of paternity signed by the mother and father acknowledging the paternity of a registrant born out of wedlock, or a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity that is witnessed by two individuals and signed under penalty of perjury as specified by s. 92.525(2), the department shall place the original certificate of birth and all papers pertaining thereto under seal, not to be broken except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction or as otherwise provided by law.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a father’s name is listed on the birth certificate, the birth certificate may only be amended to remove the father’s name or to add a different father’s name upon court order. If a change in the registrant’s surname is also desired, such change must be included in the court order or the name must be changed pursuant to s. 68.07.</Text>
