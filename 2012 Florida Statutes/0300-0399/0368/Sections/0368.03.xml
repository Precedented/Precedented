It is intended that the requirements of such rules and regulations shall be adequate for safety under conditions normally encountered in the gas industry, but requirements for abnormal or unusual conditions or all details of engineering and construction need not be specifically provided for or prescribed. It is not intended that the rules and regulations adopted pursuant hereto be applied retroactively to existing installations so far as design, fabrication, installation, establishing operating pressure and testing are concerned. It is intended, however, that the provisions of the rules and regulations shall be applicable to the operation, maintenance and uprating of existing installations. This law, and the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to it, are declared to be in the public interest and are deemed to be an exercise of the police power of the state for the protection of the public welfare and shall be liberally construed for the accomplishment of that purpose.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 59-304; s. 3, ch. 67-379.</History></Section>
