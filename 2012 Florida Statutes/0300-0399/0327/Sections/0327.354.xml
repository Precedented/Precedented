Such normal faculties include, but are not limited to, the ability to see, hear, walk, talk, judge distances, drive an automobile, make judgments, act in emergencies, and, in general, normally perform the many mental and physical acts of daily life.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At the trial of any civil or criminal action or proceeding arising out of acts alleged to have been committed by any person while operating a vessel while under the influence of alcoholic beverages or controlled substances, when affected to the extent that the person’s normal faculties were impaired or to the extent that he or she was deprived of full possession of his or her normal faculties, the results of any test administered in accordance with s. 327.352 or s. 327.353 and this section are admissible into evidence when otherwise admissible, and the amount of alcohol in the person’s blood or breath at the time alleged, as shown by chemical analysis of the person’s blood, or by chemical or physical test of the person’s breath, gives rise to the following presumptions:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.05 or less, it is presumed that the person was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08, that fact does not give rise to any presumption that the person was or was not under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired but may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If there was at that time a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher, that fact is prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired. Any person who operates a vessel and who has a blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher is guilty of operating a vessel with an unlawful blood-alcohol level or breath-alcohol level.</Text></Paragraph><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">The presumptions provided in this subsection do not limit the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcoholic beverages to the extent that his or her normal faculties were impaired.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A chemical analysis of a person’s blood to determine alcoholic content or a chemical or physical test of a person’s breath, in order to be considered valid under this section, must have been performed substantially in accordance with methods approved by the Department of Law Enforcement and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the department for this purpose. Insubstantial differences between approved techniques and actual testing procedures or insubstantial defects concerning the permit issued by the department, in any individual case, do not render the test or test results invalid. The Department of Law Enforcement may approve satisfactory techniques or methods, ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analyses, and issue permits subject to termination or revocation in accordance with rules adopted by the department.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any person charged with a violation of s. 327.35 is entitled to trial by jury according to the Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An affidavit containing the results of any test of a person’s blood or breath to determine its alcohol content, as authorized by s. 327.352 or s. 327.353, is admissible in evidence under the exception to the hearsay rule in s. 90.803(8) for public records and reports.
