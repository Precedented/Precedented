<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0377.601" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Legislative intent.</Catchline><SectionBody><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that the state’s energy security can be increased by lessening dependence on foreign oil; that the impacts of global climate change can be reduced through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; and that the implementation of alternative energy technologies can be a source of new jobs and employment opportunities for many Floridians. The Legislature further finds that the state is positioned at the front line against potential impacts of global climate change. Human and economic costs of those impacts can be averted by global actions and, where necessary, adapted to by a concerted effort to make Florida’s communities more resilient and less vulnerable to these impacts. In focusing the government’s policy and efforts to benefit and protect our state, its citizens, and its resources, the Legislature believes that a single government entity with a specific focus on energy and climate change is both desirable and advantageous. Further, the Legislature finds that energy infrastructure provides the foundation for secure and reliable access to the energy supplies and services on which Florida depends. Therefore, there is significant value to Florida consumers that comes from investment in Florida’s energy infrastructure that increases system reliability, enhances energy independence and diversification, stabilizes energy costs, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">It is the policy of the State of Florida to:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Develop and promote the effective use of energy in the state, discourage all forms of energy waste, and recognize and address the potential of global climate change wherever possible.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Play a leading role in developing and instituting energy management programs aimed at promoting energy conservation, energy security, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Include energy considerations in all state, regional, and local planning.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Utilize and manage effectively energy resources used within state agencies.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Encourage local governments to include energy considerations in all planning and to support their work in promoting energy management programs.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="f"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Include the full participation of citizens in the development and implementation of energy programs.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="g"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Consider in its decisions the energy needs of each economic sector, including residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural, and governmental uses, and reduce those needs whenever possible.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="h"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Promote energy education and the public dissemination of information on energy and its environmental, economic, and social impact.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="i"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Encourage the research, development, demonstration, and application of alternative energy resources, particularly renewable energy resources.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="j"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Consider, in its decisionmaking, the social, economic, and environmental impacts of energy-related activities, including the whole-life-cycle impacts of any potential energy use choices, so that detrimental effects of these activities are understood and minimized.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="k"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Develop and maintain energy emergency preparedness plans to minimize the effects of an energy shortage within Florida.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 74-186; s. 1, ch. 77-333; s. 2, ch. 78-25; s. 44, ch. 2008-227.</History></Section>
