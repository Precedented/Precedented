A drilling unit, as contemplated herein, means the maximum area in a pool which may be efficiently and economically drained by one well, and such unit shall constitute a developed area as long as a well is located thereon which is capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each well permitted to be drilled upon any drilling unit shall be drilled approximately in the center thereof, with such exception as may be reasonably necessary where the division finds that the unit is partly outside the pool or, for some other reason, a well approximately in the center of the unit would be nonproductive or where topographical conditions are such as to make the drilling approximately in the center of the unit unduly burdensome or where the operator proposes to complete the well with a horizontal or nearly horizontal well in the producing zone. Whenever an exception is granted, the division shall take such action as will offset any advantage which the person securing the exception may have over other producers by reason of the drilling of the well as an exception, and so that drainage from developed units to the tract, with respect to which the exception is granted, will be prevented or minimized, and the producer of the well drilled, as an exception, will be allowed to produce no more than his or her just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool, as such share is set forth in this section.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Subject to the reasonable requirements for prevention of waste, a producer’s just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool, also sometimes referred to as a tract’s just and equitable share, is that part of the authorized production for the pool, whether it be the total which could be produced without any restriction on the amount of production, or whether it be an amount less than that which the pool could produce if no restriction on amount were imposed, which is substantially in the proportion that the quantity of recoverable oil and gas in the developed area of his or her tract or tracts in the pool bears to the recoverable oil and gas in the total developed area of the pool, insofar as these amounts can be practically ascertained; and, to that end, the rules, regulations, permits, and orders of the division shall be such as will prevent or minimize reasonably avoidable net drainage from each developed unit, that is, drainage which is not equalized by counterdrainage, and will give to each producer the opportunity to use his or her just and equitable share of the reservoir energy.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 19, ch. 22819, 1945; ss. 25, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 23, ch. 78-95; s. 623, ch. 95-148; s. 76, ch. 96-323.</History></Section>
