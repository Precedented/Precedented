If the authority defaults in the payment of the principal of or interest on any of the bonds issued pursuant to the provisions of this part after such principal of or interest on the bonds becomes due, whether at maturity or upon call for redemption, and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or if the authority fails or refuses to comply with the provisions of this part or any agreement made with, or for the benefit of, the holders of the bonds, the holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the bonds then outstanding may appoint a trustee to represent such bondholders for the purposes hereof, if such holders of 25 percent in aggregate principal amount of the bonds then outstanding shall first give notice of their intention to appoint a trustee to the authority. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given if given in writing, deposited in a securely sealed postpaid wrapper, mailed at a regularly maintained United States post office box or station, and addressed to the chair of the authority.</Text>
