Such bonds are payable exclusively from revenues pledged for their payment. Each such bond shall contain a statement on its face that the state is not obligated to pay the same or the interest thereon, except from the revenues pledged for its payment, and that the faith and credit of the state is not pledged to the payment of the principal or interest of such bond. The issuance of revenue bonds under the provisions of this part does not directly, indirectly, or contingently obligate the state to levy or to pledge any form of taxation whatsoever, or to make any appropriation for their payment. No state funds shall be used to pay the principal or interest of any bonds issued to finance or refinance any portion of the authority’s transportation projects, and each such bond shall contain a statement on its face to this effect.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2007-254.</History></Section>
