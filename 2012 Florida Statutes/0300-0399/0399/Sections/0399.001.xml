The use of unsafe and defective lifting devices imposes a substantial probability of serious and preventable injury and exposes employees and the public to unsafe conditions. The prevention of these injuries and the protection of employees and the public from unsafe conditions is in the best interest of the public. Elevator personnel performing work covered by the Florida Building Code must possess documented training or experience or both and be familiar with the operation and safety functions of the components and equipment. Training and experience includes, but is not limited to, recognizing the safety hazards and performing the procedures to which they are assigned in conformance with the requirements of the Florida Building Code. This chapter establishes the minimum standards for elevator personnel.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 2001-186.</History></Section>
