The prevailing principles to be considered in planning and developing these transportation systems are: preserving the existing transportation infrastructure; enhancing Florida’s economic competitiveness; and improving travel choices to ensure mobility. This code is necessary for the protection of the public safety and general welfare and for the preservation of all transportation facilities in the state. The chapters in the code shall be considered components of the total code, and the provisions therein, unless expressly limited in scope, shall apply to all chapters.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 10, ch. 84-309; s. 41, ch. 99-385; s. 11, ch. 2000-266.</History></Section>
