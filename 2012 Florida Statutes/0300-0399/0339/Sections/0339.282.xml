In order to encourage the more efficient and proactive provision of transportation improvements by the private sector, if a developer or property owner voluntarily contributes right-of-way and physically constructs or expands a state transportation facility or segment, and such construction or expansion improves traffic flow, capacity, or safety, the voluntary contribution may be applied as a credit for that property owner or developer against any future transportation concurrency requirements pursuant to chapter 163, provided such contributions and credits are set forth in a legally binding agreement executed by the property owner or developer, the local government of the jurisdiction in which the facility is located, and the department. If the developer or property owner voluntarily contributes right-of-way and physically constructs or expands a local government facility or segment and such construction or expansion meets the requirements in this section and is set forth in a legally binding agreement between the property owner or developer and the applicable local government, the contribution to the local government collector and the arterial system may be applied as credit against any future transportation concurrency requirements within the jurisdiction under chapter 163.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 42, ch. 2007-196.</History></Section>
