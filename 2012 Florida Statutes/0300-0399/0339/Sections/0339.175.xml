			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">PURPOSE.<EmDash />It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage and promote the safe and efficient management, operation, and development of surface transportation systems that will serve the mobility needs of people and freight and foster economic growth and development within and through urbanized areas of this state while minimizing transportation-related fuel consumption, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions through metropolitan transportation planning processes identified in this section. To accomplish these objectives, metropolitan planning organizations, referred to in this section as M.P.O.’s, shall develop, in cooperation with the state and public transit operators, transportation plans and programs for metropolitan areas. The plans and programs for each metropolitan area must provide for the development and integrated management and operation of transportation systems and facilities, including pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities that will function as an intermodal transportation system for the metropolitan area, based upon the prevailing principles provided in s. 334.046(1). The process for developing such plans and programs shall provide for consideration of all modes of transportation and shall be continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive, to the degree appropriate, based on the complexity of the transportation problems to be addressed. To ensure that the process is integrated with the statewide planning process, M.P.O.’s shall develop plans and programs that identify transportation facilities that should function as an integrated metropolitan transportation system, giving emphasis to facilities that serve important national, state, and regional transportation functions. For the purposes of this section, those facilities include the facilities on the Strategic Intermodal System designated under s. 339.63 and facilities for which projects have been identified pursuant to s. 339.2819(4).</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area of the state; however, this does not require that an individual M.P.O. be designated for each such area. Such designation shall be accomplished by agreement between the Governor and units of general-purpose local government representing at least 75 percent of the population of the urbanized area; however, the unit of general-purpose local government that represents the central city or cities within the M.P.O. jurisdiction, as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census, must be a party to such agreement.</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">To the extent possible, only one M.P.O. shall be designated for each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than one M.P.O. may be designated within an existing urbanized area only if the Governor and the existing M.P.O. determine that the size and complexity of the existing urbanized area makes the designation of more than one M.P.O. for the area appropriate.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each M.P.O. designated in a manner prescribed by Title 23 of the United States Code shall be created and operated under the provisions of this section pursuant to an interlocal agreement entered into pursuant to s. 163.01. The signatories to the interlocal agreement shall be the department and the governmental entities designated by the Governor for membership on the M.P.O. Each M.P.O. shall be considered separate from the state or the governing body of a local government that is represented on the governing board of the M.P.O. or that is a signatory to the interlocal agreement creating the M.P.O. and shall have such powers and privileges that are provided under s. 163.01.

If more than one M.P.O. has authority within a metropolitan area or an area that is designated as a nonattainment area, each M.P.O. shall consult with other M.P.O.’s designated for such area and with the state in the coordination of plans and programs required by this section.</Text>
