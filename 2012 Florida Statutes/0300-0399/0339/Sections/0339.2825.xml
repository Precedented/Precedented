The summary must include a description of any anticipated commitment by the department for the years outside the adopted work program, a description of the anticipated impacts on the department’s overall debt load, and sufficient information to demonstrate that the project will not cause the department to exceed the overall debt limitation provided in s. 339.139. The department may proceed with the project upon approval of the Governor. If the chair of either legislative appropriations committee, the President of the Senate, or the Speaker of the House of Representatives objects to the proposed project in writing within 14 days after receipt of the summary, the Governor may not approve the project.</Text>
