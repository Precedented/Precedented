The sheriff of the county in which the certificate was issued shall take such person into custody and shall deliver the person to the nearest available licensed hospital, or to another location where isolation is available, as appropriate, for observation, examination, and treatment for a period not to exceed 72 hours, pending a hearing scheduled under s. 392.55 or s. 392.56. The certificate must be filed with the circuit court in which the person is involuntarily held and constitutes a petition for a hearing under s. 392.55 or s. 392.56.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 94-320; s. 1042, ch. 95-148; s. 35, ch. 97-237.</History></Section>
