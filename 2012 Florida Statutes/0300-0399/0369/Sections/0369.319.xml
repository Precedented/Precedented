The plan shall also identify a funding source, such as a stormwater utility fee, to fund implementation of the plan and maintenance program. In addition, the local government shall establish a water reuse and irrigation program that allows for reuse of stormwater on a site basis for development over a size threshold to be determined by the local government or on a jurisdiction-wide basis to minimize pumpage of groundwater for nonpotable usage. For those local governments located partially within the Wekiva Study Area, this section applies only to that portion located within the Wekiva Study Area.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2004-384; s. 2, ch. 2005-106.</History></Section>
