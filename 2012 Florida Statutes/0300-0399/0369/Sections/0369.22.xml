			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature recognizes that the uncontrolled growth of aquatic plants in the waters of Florida poses a variety of environmental, health, safety, and economic problems. The Legislature acknowledges the responsibility of the state to cope with the uncontrolled and seemingly never-ending growth of aquatic plants in the waters throughout Florida. It is, therefore, the intent of the Legislature that the state policy for the management of aquatic plants in waters of state responsibility be carried out under the general supervision and control of the commission. It is the intent of the Legislature that the management of aquatic plants be carried out primarily by means of maintenance programs, rather than eradication or complaint spray programs, for the purpose of achieving more effective management at a lower long-range cost. It is also the intent of the Legislature that the commission guide, review, approve, and coordinate all aquatic plant management programs within each of the water management districts as defined in paragraph (2)(g). It is the intent of the Legislature to account for the costs of aquatic plant management programs by watershed for comparison purposes.</Text>
