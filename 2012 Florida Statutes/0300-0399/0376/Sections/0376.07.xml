		<Subsection Id="3">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall not require vessels to maintain discharge prevention gear, holding tanks, and containment gear which exceed federal requirements. However, a terminal facility transferring heavy oil to or from a vessel with a heavy oil storage capacity greater than 10,000 gallons shall be required, considering existing weather and tidal conditions, to adequately boom or seal off the transfer area during a transfer, including, but not limited to, a bunkering operation, to minimize the escape of such pollutants from the containment area. As used in this subsection, the term “adequate booming” means booming with proper containment equipment which is employed and located for the purpose of preventing, for the most likely discharge, as much of the pollutant as possible from escaping out of the containment area.</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The owner or operator of a terminal facility involved in the transfer of such pollutant to or from a vessel which is not adequately boomed commits a noncriminal infraction and shall be cited for such infraction. The civil penalty for such an infraction shall be $2,500, except as otherwise provided in this section.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A person cited for an infraction under this section may:</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">After compliance with subparagraph (b)2. or subparagraph (b)3., a person charged with a noncriminal infraction under this section may:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Pay the civil penalty, either by mail or in person, within 30 days after the date of receiving the citation; or</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the person has posted bond, forfeit the bond by not appearing at the designated time and location.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">A person cited for an infraction under this section who pays the civil penalty or forfeits the bond has admitted the infraction and waives the right to a hearing on the issue of commission of the infraction. Such admission may not be used as evidence in any other proceedings.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="e">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A person who elects to appear before the county court or who is required to appear waives the limitations of the civil penalty specified in paragraph (a). The issue of whether an infraction has been committed and the severity of the infraction shall be determined by a hearing official at a hearing. If the commission of the infraction is proved by the greater weight of the evidence, the court shall impose a civil penalty of $2,500. If the court determines that the owner or operator of the terminal facility failed to deploy any boom equipment during such a transfer, including, but not limited to, a bunkering operation, the civil penalty shall be $5,000.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="f">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A person who is found by the hearing official to have committed an infraction may appeal that finding to the circuit court.</Text>
