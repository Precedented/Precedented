			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Brownfield Areas Loan Guarantee Council is created to review and approve or deny, by a majority vote of its membership, the situations and circumstances for participation in partnerships by agreements with local governments, financial institutions, and others associated with the redevelopment of brownfield areas pursuant to the Brownfields Redevelopment Act for a limited state guaranty of up to 5 years of loan guarantees or loan loss reserves issued pursuant to law. The limited state loan guaranty applies only to 50 percent of the primary lenders loans for redevelopment projects in brownfield areas. If the redevelopment project is for affordable housing, as defined in s. 420.0004, in a brownfield area, the limited state loan guaranty applies to 75 percent of the primary lender’s loan. If the redevelopment project includes the construction and operation of a new health care facility or a health care provider, as defined in s. 408.032, s. 408.07, or s. 408.7056, on a brownfield site and the applicant has obtained documentation in accordance with s. 376.30781 indicating that the construction of the health care facility or health care provider by the applicant on the brownfield site has received a certificate of occupancy or a license or certificate has been issued for the operation of the health care facility or health care provider, the limited state loan guaranty applies to 75 percent of the primary lender’s loan. A limited state guaranty of private loans or a loan loss reserve is authorized for lenders licensed to operate in the state upon a determination by the council that such an arrangement would be in the public interest and the likelihood of the success of the loan is great.</Text>
