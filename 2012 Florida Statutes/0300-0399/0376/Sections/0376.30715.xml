For purposes of this section, the term “acquired” means the acquisition of title to the property; however, a subsequent transfer of the property to a spouse or child of the owner, a surviving spouse or child of the owner in trust or free of trust, a revocable trust created for the benefit of the settlor, or a corporate entity created by the owner to hold title to the site does not disqualify the site from financial assistance pursuant to s. 376.305(6), and applicants previously denied coverage may reapply. Eligible sites shall be ranked in accordance with s. 376.3071(5).</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 28, 54, 55, ch. 2005-71; s. 4, ch. 2005-180; s. 1, ch. 2008-239; s. 10, ch. 2012-205.</History></Section>
