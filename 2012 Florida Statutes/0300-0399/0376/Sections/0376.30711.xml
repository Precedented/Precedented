This has resulted in a large backlog of reimbursement applications and excessive costs to the Inland Protection Trust Fund. It is the intent of the Legislature that contamination site cleanups be conducted on a preapproved basis with emphasis on addressing first the sites which pose the greatest threat to human health and the environment, within the availability of funds in the Inland Protection Trust Fund, recognizing that source removal, wherever it is technologically feasible and cost-effective and will significantly reduce the contamination or eliminate the spread of contamination, shall be considered to protect public health and safety, water resources, and the environment.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Site rehabilitation work on sites eligible for state-funded cleanup from the Inland Protection Trust Fund and pursuant to ss. 376.305(6), 376.3071, 376.3072, and 376.3073, shall only be eligible for site rehabilitation funding under this section. After March 29, 1995, only persons who have received prior written approval from the department of the scope of work and costs may continue site rehabilitation work. In the event of a new release, the facility operator shall be required to abate the source of the discharge. If free product is present, the operator shall notify the department, which may direct the removal of the free product as a preapproved expense pursuant to this section. The department shall grant approval to continue site rehabilitation based on this section and s. 376.3071(5).</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Competitive bidding pursuant to this section shall not be subject to the requirements of s. 287.055.
