A tax credit applicant, or multiple tax credit applicants working jointly to clean up a single brownfield site, may also claim costs to address the solid waste removal as defined in this paragraph in accordance with department rules. Multiple tax credit applicants shall be granted tax credits in the same proportion as each applicant’s contribution to payment of solid waste removal costs. These costs are eligible for a tax credit provided the applicant submits an affidavit stating that, after consultation with appropriate local government officials and the department, to the best of the applicant’s knowledge based upon such consultation and available historical records, the brownfield site was never operated as a permitted solid waste disposal area or was never operated for monetary compensation, and the applicant submits all other documentation and certifications required by this section. In this section, where reference is made to “site rehabilitation,” the department shall instead consider whether the costs claimed are for solid waste removal. Tax credit applications claiming costs pursuant to this paragraph shall not be subject to the calendar-year limitation and January 31 annual application deadline, and the department shall accept a one-time application filed subsequent to the completion by the tax credit applicant of the applicable requirements listed in this subsection.
