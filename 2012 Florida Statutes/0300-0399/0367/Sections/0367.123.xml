However, before requiring the provision of service, the commission shall first find that the utility is financially able to make such additional investment as is required without impairing its capacity to serve its existing customers. Any utility which provides service for resale shall provide such service upon terms and conditions established by the commission, and no utility shall discontinue such service without the approval of the commission. In the event a governmental authority voluntarily enters into an agreement for resale, such agreement shall provide that the service will not be discontinued without 90 days’ notice being given to the purchaser prior to discontinuing such service. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the governmental authority from requiring adequate security being given to such authority to ensure payments required in the agreement.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 71-278; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 17, 25, 26, ch. 80-99; s. 218, ch. 81-259; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 18, 26, 27, ch. 89-353; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
