Such statement of deficiencies shall be binding upon the commission to the extent that, once the deficiencies in the statement are satisfied, the official date of filing shall be promptly established as provided herein. Thereafter, within 20 days after the applicant indicates to the commission that it believes that it has met the minimum filing requirements, the commission or its designee shall either determine the official date of filing or issue another statement of deficiencies, specifically listing why the requirements have not been met, in which case this procedure shall be repeated until the applicant meets the minimum filing requirements and the official date of filing is established. When the commission initiates a proceeding, the official date of filing shall be the date upon which the order initiating the proceeding is issued.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 4, 26, ch. 80-99; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 11, 26, 27, ch. 89-353; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
