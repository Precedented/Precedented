The commission has 15 months after the official date of filing within which to issue a final order.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The provisions of s. 367.081(1), (2)(a), and (3) shall apply in determining the utility’s rates and charges.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The commission may, upon its own motion, or upon petition from the regulated utility, authorize the collection of interim rates until the effective date of the final order. Such interim rates may be based upon a test period different from the test period used in the request for permanent rate relief. To establish interim relief, there must be a demonstration that the operation and maintenance expenses exceed the revenues of the regulated utility, and interim rates shall not exceed the level necessary to cover operation and maintenance expenses as defined by the Uniform System of Accounts for Class C Water and Wastewater Utilities (1996) of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The commission may require that the difference between the interim rates and the previously authorized rates be collected under bond, escrow, letter of credit, or corporate undertaking subject to refund with interest at a rate ordered by the commission.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The utility, in requesting staff assistance, shall agree to accept the final rates and charges approved by the commission unless the final rates and charges produce less revenue than the existing rates and charges.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In the event of a protest or appeal by a party other than the utility, the commission may provide for temporary rates subject to refund with interest.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="8"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a utility becomes exempt from commission regulation or jurisdiction during the pendency of a staff-assisted rate case, the request for rate relief is deemed to have been withdrawn.
