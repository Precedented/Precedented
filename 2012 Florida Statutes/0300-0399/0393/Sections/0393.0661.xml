	<SectionBody>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that the home and community-based services delivery system for persons with developmental disabilities and the availability of appropriated funds are two of the critical elements in making services available. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Agency for Persons with Disabilities shall develop and implement a comprehensive redesign of the system.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The agency shall use an assessment instrument that the agency deems to be reliable and valid, including, but not limited to, the Department of Children and Family Services’ Individual Cost Guidelines or the agency’s Questionnaire for Situational Information. The agency may contract with an external vendor or may use support coordinators to complete client assessments if it develops sufficient safeguards and training to ensure ongoing inter-rater reliability.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Agency for Health Care Administration, in consultation with the agency, shall seek federal approval and implement a four-tiered waiver system to serve eligible clients through the developmental disabilities and family and supported living waivers. For the purpose of this waiver program, eligible clients shall include individuals with a diagnosis of Down syndrome or a developmental disability as defined in s. 393.063. The agency shall assign all clients receiving services through the developmental disabilities waiver to a tier based on the Department of Children and Family Services’ Individual Cost Guidelines, the agency’s Questionnaire for Situational Information, or another such assessment instrument deemed to be valid and reliable by the agency; client characteristics, including, but not limited to, age; and other appropriate assessment methods.</Text>

The agency shall use actual paid claims for services provided during the previous fiscal year that are submitted by October 31 to calculate the revised cost plan amount. If the client was not served for the entire previous state fiscal year or there was any single change in the cost plan amount of more than 5 percent during the previous state fiscal year, the agency shall set the cost plan amount at an estimated annualized expenditure amount plus 5 percent. The agency shall estimate the annualized expenditure amount by calculating the average of monthly expenditures, beginning in the fourth month after the client enrolled, interrupted services are resumed, or the cost plan was changed by more than 5 percent and ending on August 31, 2009, and multiplying the average by 12. In order to determine whether a client was not served for the entire year, the agency shall include any interruption of a waiver-funded service or services lasting at least 18 days. If at least 3 months of actual expenditure data are not available to estimate annualized expenditures, the agency may not rebase a cost plan pursuant to this subsection.
