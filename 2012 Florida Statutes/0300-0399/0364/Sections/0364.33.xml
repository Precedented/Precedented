		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A person may not provide telecommunications services to the public without a certificate of necessity or a certificate of authority. After July 1, 2011, the commission shall cease to issue certificates of necessity, but existing certificates of necessity remain valid. A certificate of necessity or authority may be transferred to the holder’s parent company or an affiliate or another person holding a certificate of necessity or authority, its parent company, or an affiliate without prior approval of the commission by giving written notice of the transfer to the commission within 60 days after the completion of the transfer. The transferee assumes the rights and obligations conferred by the certificate. This section does not affect any obligation of the transferee pursuant to 47 U.S.C. ss. 251 and 252 and the Federal Communications Commission’s orders and regulations implementing those sections.</Text>
