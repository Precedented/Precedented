Such provisions do not apply to acres disturbed by the severance of phosphate rock prior to July 1, 1975, and, therefore, do not affect the determination of whether lands disturbed by the severance of phosphate rock are subject to the mandatory reclamation obligation. This part shall not be construed as giving the department permitting authority over mining operations.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 86-294.</History></Section>
