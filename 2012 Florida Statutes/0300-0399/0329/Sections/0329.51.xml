The lienor must record such lien notice within 90 days after the time the labor, services, fuel, or material was last furnished. The notice must state the name of the lienor; the name of the owner; a description of the aircraft upon which the lienor has expended labor, services, fuel, or material; the amount for which the lien is claimed; and the date the expenditure was completed. This section does not affect the priority of competing interests in any aircraft or the lienor’s obligation to record the lien under s. 329.01.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 83-272; s. 3, ch. 84-259; s. 2, ch. 93-73; s. 473, ch. 95-148.</History></Section>
