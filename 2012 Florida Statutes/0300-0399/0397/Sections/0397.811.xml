The economic cost of substance abuse impairment to the state drains existing resources, and the cost to victims, both economic and psychological, is traumatic and tragic. The Legislature also recognizes that substance abuse impairment is a community problem, a family problem, a societal problem, and a judicial problem and that there is a critical need to address this emergency immediately. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that scarce funds be invested in prevention and early intervention programs.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">It is the intent of the Legislature to provide authority for the department to expand existing services to juveniles, to contract with community-based substance abuse service providers for the provision of specialized services, and to have prototype models developed prior to statewide implementation.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 10, ch. 93-39; s. 5, ch. 99-187.</History></Section>
