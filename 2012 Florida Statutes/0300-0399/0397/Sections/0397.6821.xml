<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0397.6821" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Extension of time for completion of involuntary assessment and stabilization.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a licensed service provider is unable to complete the involuntary assessment and, if necessary, stabilization of an individual within 5 days after the court’s order, it may, within the original time period, file a written request for an extension of time to complete its assessment, and shall, in accordance with confidentiality requirements, furnish a copy to all parties. With or without a hearing, the court may grant additional time, not to exceed 7 days after the date of the renewal order, for the completion of the involuntary assessment and stabilization of the individual. The original court order authorizing the involuntary assessment and stabilization, or a request for an extension of time to complete the assessment and stabilization that is timely filed pursuant to this section, constitutes legal authority to involuntarily hold the individual for a period not to exceed 10 days in the absence of a court order to the contrary.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 93-39; s. 35, ch. 2009-132.</History></Section>
