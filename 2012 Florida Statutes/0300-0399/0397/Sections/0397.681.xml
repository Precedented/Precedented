A respondent who desires counsel and is unable to afford private counsel has the right to court-appointed counsel and to the benefits of s. 57.081. If the court believes that the respondent needs the assistance of counsel, the court shall appoint such counsel for the respondent without regard to the respondent’s wishes. If the respondent is a minor not otherwise represented in the proceeding, the court shall immediately appoint a guardian ad litem to act on the minor’s behalf.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 93-39; s. 745, ch. 95-148; s. 79, ch. 2004-11.</History></Section>
