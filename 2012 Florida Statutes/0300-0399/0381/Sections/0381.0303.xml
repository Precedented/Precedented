Local emergency management agencies may request the assistance of a multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team by alerting statewide emergency management officials of the necessity for additional assistance in their area. The Secretary of Elderly Affairs is encouraged to proactively work with other state agencies prior to any natural disasters for which warnings are provided to ensure that multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning teams are ready to assemble and deploy rapidly upon a determination by state emergency management officials that a disaster area requires additional assistance. The Secretary of Elderly Affairs may call upon any state agency or office to provide staff to assist a multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team. Unless the secretary determines that the nature or circumstances surrounding the disaster do not warrant participation from a particular agency’s staff, each multiagency special needs shelter discharge planning team shall include at least one representative from each of the following state agencies:</Text>
