The right of entry extends to any premises that the department has reason to believe is being established, maintained, or operated as a migrant labor camp or residential migrant housing without a permit, but such entry may not be made without the permission of the owner, person in charge, or resident thereof, unless an inspection warrant is first obtained from the circuit court authorizing the entry. Any application for a permit made under s. 381.0082 constitutes permission for, and complete acquiescence in, any entry or inspection of the premises for which the permit is sought, to verify the information submitted on or in connection with the application; to discover, investigate, and determine the existence of any violation of ss. 381.008-381.00895 or rules adopted thereunder; or to elicit, receive, respond to, and resolve complaints. Any current valid permit constitutes unconditional permission for, and complete acquiescence in, any entry or inspection of the premises by authorized personnel. The department may from time to time publish the reports of such inspections.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 59-476; ss. 19, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 90, ch. 77-147; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 8, 9, 10, ch. 83-249; s. 40, ch. 91-297; ss. 9, 15, ch. 93-133.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 381.482.</Text></Note></Section>
