The department may issue permits to carry out this section, but shall not make the issuance of such permits contingent upon prior approval by the Department of Environmental Protection, except that the issuance of a permit for work seaward of the coastal construction control line established under s. 161.053 shall be contingent upon receipt of any required coastal construction control line permit from the Department of Environmental Protection. A construction permit is valid for 18 months from the issuance date and may be extended by the department for one 90-day period under rules adopted by the department. A repair permit is valid for 90 days from the date of issuance. An operating permit must be obtained prior to the use of any aerobic treatment unit or if the establishment generates commercial waste. Buildings or establishments that use an aerobic treatment unit or generate commercial waste shall be inspected by the department at least annually to assure compliance with the terms of the operating permit. The operating permit for a commercial wastewater system is valid for 1 year from the date of issuance and must be renewed annually. The operating permit for an aerobic treatment unit is valid for 2 years from the date of issuance and must be renewed every 2 years. If all information pertaining to the siting, location, and installation conditions or repair of an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system remains the same, a construction or repair permit for the onsite sewage treatment and disposal system may be transferred to another person, if the transferee files, within 60 days after the transfer of ownership, an amended application providing all corrected information and proof of ownership of the property.

A person may not contract to construct, modify, alter, repair, service, abandon, or maintain any portion of an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system without being registered under part III of chapter 489. A property owner who personally performs construction, maintenance, or repairs to a system serving his or her own owner-occupied single-family residence is exempt from registration requirements for performing such construction, maintenance, or repairs on that residence, but is subject to all permitting requirements. A municipality or political subdivision of the state may not issue a building or plumbing permit for any building that requires the use of an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system unless the owner or builder has received a construction permit for such system from the department. A building or structure may not be occupied and a municipality, political subdivision, or any state or federal agency may not authorize occupancy until the department approves the final installation of the onsite sewage treatment and disposal system. A municipality or political subdivision of the state may not approve any change in occupancy or tenancy of a building that uses an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system until the department has reviewed the use of the system with the proposed change, approved the change, and amended the operating permit.</Text>

	<Note Reference="1">
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The citation apparently refers to s. 9, Art. VIII of the Constitution of 1885, which relates to Jacksonville’s consolidated government; Article VIII of the State Constitution of 1968 does not contain a s. 9, but s. 6, Art. VIII does provide a Schedule to Article VIII retaining specified provisions of the Constitution of 1885 by reference; s. 9, Art. VIII is included among these provisions.</Text>
