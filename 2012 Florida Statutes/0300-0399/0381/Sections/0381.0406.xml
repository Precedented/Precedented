			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT.<EmDash /></Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that, in rural areas, access to health care is limited and the quality of health care is negatively affected by inadequate financing, difficulty in recruiting and retaining skilled health professionals, and because of a migration of patients to urban areas for general acute care and specialty services.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature further finds that the efficient and effective delivery of health care services in rural areas requires the integration of public and private resources and the coordination of health care providers.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature further finds that the availability of a continuum of quality health care services, including preventive, primary, secondary, tertiary, and long-term care, is essential to the economic and social vitality of rural communities.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature further finds that the creation of rural health networks can help to alleviate these problems. Rural health networks shall act in the broad public interest and, to the extent possible, be structured to provide a continuum of quality health care services for rural residents through the cooperative efforts of rural health network members.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="e">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature further finds that rural health networks shall have the goal of increasing the utilization of statutory rural hospitals for appropriate health care services whenever feasible, which shall help to ensure their survival and thereby support the economy and protect the health and safety of rural residents.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="f">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Finally, the Legislature finds that rural health networks may serve as “laboratories” to determine the best way of organizing rural health services, to move the state closer to ensuring that everyone has access to health care, and to promote cost containment efforts. The ultimate goal of rural health networks shall be to ensure that quality health care is available and efficiently delivered to all persons in rural areas.</Text>
