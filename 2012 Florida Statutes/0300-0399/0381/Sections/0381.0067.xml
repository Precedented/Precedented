If the improper condition relates to the drainfield of an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system, the department or its agents may issue an order requiring the owner to repair or replace the drainfield. If an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system has failed, the department or its agents shall issue an order requiring the owner to replace the system. For purposes of this section, an onsite sewage treatment and disposal system has failed if the operation of the system constitutes a nuisance or menace to the public health or significantly degrades the groundwater or surface water and the system cannot be repaired.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 29834, 1955; ss. 19, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 74, ch. 77-147; s. 17, ch. 77-337; s. 28, ch. 91-297; s. 6, ch. 93-151; s. 6, ch. 2006-252.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 381.291.</Text></Note></Section>
