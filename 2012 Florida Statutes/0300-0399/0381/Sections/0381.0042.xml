Such networks shall be delineated by rule of the department which shall take into account natural trade areas and centers of medical excellence that specialize in the treatment of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, as well as available federal, state, and other funds. Each patient care network shall include representation of persons with human immunodeficiency virus infection; health care providers; business interests; the department, including, but not limited to, county health departments; and local units of government. Each network shall plan for the care and treatment of persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome and acquired immune deficiency syndrome related complex in a cost-effective, dignified manner which emphasizes outpatient and home care. Once each year, beginning April 1989, each network shall make its recommendations concerning the needs for patient care to the department.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 39, ch. 88-380; s. 17, ch. 91-297; s. 36, ch. 97-101.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 381.612.</Text></Note></Section>
