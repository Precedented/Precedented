			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Office of Commercial Vehicle Enforcement may issue out-of-service orders to motor carriers, as defined in s. 320.01(33), who, after proper notice, have failed to pay any penalty or fine assessed by the department, or its agent, against any owner or motor carrier for violations of state law, refused to submit to a compliance review and provide records pursuant to s. 316.302(5) or s. 316.70, or violated safety regulations pursuant to s. 316.302 or insurance requirements in s. 627.7415. Such out-of-service orders have the effect of prohibiting the operations of any motor vehicles owned, leased, or otherwise operated by the motor carrier upon the roadways of this state, until the violations have been corrected or penalties have been paid. Out-of-service orders must be approved by the director of the Division of the Florida Highway Patrol or his or her designee. An administrative hearing pursuant to s. 120.569 shall be afforded to motor carriers subject to such orders.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any motor carrier enjoined or prohibited from operating by an out-of-service order by this state, any other state, or the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration may not operate on the roadways of this state until the motor carrier has been authorized to resume operations by the originating enforcement jurisdiction. Commercial motor vehicles owned or operated by any motor carrier prohibited from operation found on the roadways of this state shall be placed out of service by law enforcement officers of the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, and the motor carrier assessed a $10,000 civil penalty pursuant to 49 C.F.R. s. 383.53, in addition to any other penalties imposed on the driver or other responsible person. Any person who knowingly drives, operates, or causes to be operated any commercial motor vehicle in violation of an out-of-service order issued by the department in accordance with this section commits a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082(3)(d). Any costs associated with the impoundment or storage of such vehicles are the responsibility of the motor carrier. Vehicle out-of-service orders may be rescinded when the department receives proof of authorization for the motor carrier to resume operation.</Text>
