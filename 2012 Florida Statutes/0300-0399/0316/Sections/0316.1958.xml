However, when an individual is required by law to have a Florida driver’s license or a Florida vehicle registration, a special motor vehicle license plate or parking permit issued by another state, district, or country to persons who have disabilities is not valid and the individual whose vehicle displays such an invalid plate or permit is subject to the same penalty as an individual whose vehicle does not display a valid plate or permit. A law enforcement officer or parking enforcement specialist may not ticket a vehicle for a violation of s. 316.1955 without first determining whether the vehicle is transporting a resident of another state who is the owner of the out-of-state placard.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 85-227; s. 26, ch. 90-330; s. 4, ch. 96-200; s. 2, ch. 98-202; s. 2, ch. 99-248.</History></Section>
