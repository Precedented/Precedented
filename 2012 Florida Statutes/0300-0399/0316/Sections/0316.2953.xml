A sunscreening material is authorized for such windows if, when applied to and tested on the glass of such windows on the specific motor vehicle, the material has a total solar reflectance of visible light of not more than 25 percent as measured on the nonfilm side and a light transmittance of at least 28 percent in the visible light range. A violation of this section is a noncriminal traffic infraction, punishable as a nonmoving violation as provided in chapter 318.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 84-296; s. 1, ch. 91-42; s. 209, ch. 99-248.</History></Section>
