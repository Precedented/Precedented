The Maitland Boulevard Extension will extend from the current terminus of State Road 414 at U.S. 441 west to State Road 429 in west Orange County. The realigned portion of the Northwest Beltway Part A will run from the point at or near where the Maitland Boulevard Extension will connect with State Road 429 and will proceed to the west and then north resulting in the northern terminus of State Road 429 moving farther west before reconnecting with U.S. 441. However, under no circumstances shall the realignment of the Northwest Beltway Part A conflict or contradict with the alignment of the Wekiva Parkway as defined in s. 348.7546.
