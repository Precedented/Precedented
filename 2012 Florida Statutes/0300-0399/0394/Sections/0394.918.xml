The notice must contain a waiver of rights. The director of the facility shall forward the notice and waiver form to the court.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The court shall hold a limited hearing to determine whether there is probable cause to believe that the person’s condition has so changed that it is safe for the person to be at large and that the person will not engage in acts of sexual violence if discharged. The person has the right to be represented by counsel at the probable cause hearing, but the person is not entitled to be present. If the court determines that there is probable cause to believe it is safe to release the person, the court shall set a trial before the court on the issue.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At the trial before the court, the person is entitled to be present and is entitled to the benefit of all constitutional protections afforded the person at the initial trial, except for the right to a jury. The state attorney shall represent the state and has the right to have the person examined by professionals chosen by the state. At the hearing, the state bears the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the person’s mental condition remains such that it is not safe for the person to be at large and that, if released, the person is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 10, ch. 98-64; s. 13, ch. 99-222.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 916.38.</Text></Note></Section>
