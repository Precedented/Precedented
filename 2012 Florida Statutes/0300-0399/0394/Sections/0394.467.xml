The recommendation must be supported by the opinion of a psychiatrist and the second opinion of a clinical psychologist or another psychiatrist, both of whom have personally examined the patient within the preceding 72 hours, that the criteria for involuntary inpatient placement are met. However, in a county that has a population of fewer than 50,000, if the administrator certifies that a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist is not available to provide the second opinion, the second opinion may be provided by a licensed physician who has postgraduate training and experience in diagnosis and treatment of mental and nervous disorders or by a psychiatric nurse. Any second opinion authorized in this subsection may be conducted through a face-to-face examination, in person or by electronic means. Such recommendation shall be entered on an involuntary inpatient placement certificate that authorizes the receiving facility to retain the patient pending transfer to a treatment facility or completion of a hearing.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">PETITION FOR INVOLUNTARY INPATIENT PLACEMENT.<EmDash />The administrator of the facility shall file a petition for involuntary inpatient placement in the court in the county where the patient is located.

No fee shall be charged for the filing of a petition under this subsection.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL.<EmDash />Within 1 court working day after the filing of a petition for involuntary inpatient placement, the court shall appoint the public defender to represent the person who is the subject of the petition, unless the person is otherwise represented by counsel. The clerk of the court shall immediately notify the public defender of such appointment. Any attorney representing the patient shall have access to the patient, witnesses, and records relevant to the presentation of the patient’s case and shall represent the interests of the patient, regardless of the source of payment to the attorney.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">CONTINUANCE OF HEARING.<EmDash />The patient is entitled, with the concurrence of the patient’s counsel, to at least one continuance of the hearing.

The hearing shall be held in the county where the patient is located and shall be as convenient to the patient as may be consistent with orderly procedure and shall be conducted in physical settings not likely to be injurious to the patient’s condition. If the court finds that the patient’s attendance at the hearing is not consistent with the best interests of the patient, and the patient’s counsel does not object, the court may waive the presence of the patient from all or any portion of the hearing. The state attorney for the circuit in which the patient is located shall represent the state, rather than the petitioning facility administrator, as the real party in interest in the proceeding.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The court may appoint a general or special magistrate to preside at the hearing. One of the professionals who executed the involuntary inpatient placement certificate shall be a witness.

If the patient cannot afford such an examination, the court shall provide for one. The independent expert’s report shall be confidential and not discoverable, unless the expert is to be called as a witness for the patient at the hearing. The testimony in the hearing must be given under oath, and the proceedings must be recorded. The patient may refuse to testify at the hearing.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the court concludes that the patient meets the criteria for involuntary inpatient placement, it shall order that the patient be transferred to a treatment facility or, if the patient is at a treatment facility, that the patient be retained there or be treated at any other appropriate receiving or treatment facility, or that the patient receive services from a receiving or treatment facility, on an involuntary basis, for a period of up to 6 months.

The petition and hearing procedures set forth in s. 394.4655 shall apply. If the person instead meets the criteria for involuntary assessment, protective custody, or involuntary admission pursuant to s. 397.675, then the court may order the person to be admitted for involuntary assessment for a period of 5 days pursuant to s. 397.6811. Thereafter, all proceedings shall be governed by chapter 397.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At the hearing on involuntary inpatient placement, the court shall consider testimony and evidence regarding the patient’s competence to consent to treatment.

The documentation shall include any advance directives made by the patient, a psychiatric evaluation of the patient, and any evaluations of the patient performed by a clinical psychologist, a marriage and family therapist, a mental health counselor, or a clinical social worker. The administrator of a treatment facility may refuse admission to any patient directed to its facilities on an involuntary basis, whether by civil or criminal court order, who is not accompanied at the same time by adequate orders and documentation.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">PROCEDURE FOR CONTINUED INVOLUNTARY INPATIENT PLACEMENT.<EmDash /></Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Hearings on petitions for continued involuntary inpatient placement shall be administrative hearings and shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of s. 120.57(1), except that any order entered by the administrative law judge shall be final and subject to judicial review in accordance with s. 120.68.

The request shall be accompanied by a statement from the patient’s physician or clinical psychologist justifying the request, a brief description of the patient’s treatment during the time he or she was involuntarily placed, and an individualized plan of continued treatment. Notice of the hearing shall be provided as set forth in s. 394.4599.

If the administrative law judge finds evidence that the patient is now competent to consent to treatment, the administrative law judge may issue a recommended order to the court that found the patient incompetent to consent to treatment that the patient’s competence be restored and that any guardian advocate previously appointed be discharged.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="8"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">RETURN OF PATIENTS.<EmDash />When a patient at a treatment facility leaves the facility without authorization, the administrator may authorize a search for the patient and the return of the patient to the facility.
