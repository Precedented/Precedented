		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The owner of a motor vehicle or mobile home upon which a lien has been filed with the department or noted upon a certificate of title for a period of 5 years may apply to the department in writing for such lien to be removed from the department files or from the certificate of title. The application shall be accompanied by evidence satisfactory to the department that the applicant has notified the lienholder by certified mail, not less than 20 days prior to the date of the application, of his or her intention to apply to the department for removal of the lien. Ten days after receipt of the application, the department may remove the lien from its files or from the certificate of title, as the case may be, if no statement in writing protesting removal of the lien is received by the department from the lienholder within the 10-day period. If, however, the lienholder files with the department within the 10-day period a written statement that the lien is still outstanding, the department shall not remove the lien until the lienholder presents a satisfaction of lien to the department. Ten days after the receipt of an application for a derelict motor vehicle certificate and notification to the lienholder, the department may remove the lien from the derelict motor vehicle record if a written statement protesting removal of the lien is not received by the department from the lienholder within the 10-day period.</Text>
