			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A duly authorized person shall sign the original certificate of title and each corrected certificate and, if there are no liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, as shown in the records of the department or as shown in the application, shall deliver the certificate to the applicant or to another person as directed by the applicant or person, agent, or attorney submitting such application. The motor vehicle dealer license number must be submitted to the department when a dealer applies for or receives a duplicate title. The current odometer reading must be submitted on an application for a duplicate title. If there are one or more liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, the certificate shall be delivered by the department to the first lienholder as shown by department records or to the owner as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder pursuant to s. 319.27. If the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder indicates that the certificate should be delivered to the first lienholder, the department shall deliver to the first lienholder, along with the certificate, a form to be subsequently used by the lienholder as a satisfaction. If the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder directs the certificate of title to be delivered to the owner, then, upon delivery of the certificate of title by the department to the owner, the department shall deliver to the first lienholder confirmation of the receipt of the notice of lien and the date the certificate of title was issued to the owner at the owner’s address shown on the notice of lien and a form to be subsequently used by the lienholder as a satisfaction. If the application for certificate shows the name of a first lienholder different from the name of the first lienholder as shown by the records of the department, the certificate shall not be issued to any person until after all parties who appear to hold a lien and the applicant for the certificate have been notified of the conflict in writing by the department by certified mail. If the parties do not amicably resolve the conflict within 10 days from the date such notice was mailed, then the department shall serve notice in writing by certified mail on all persons appearing to hold liens on that particular vehicle, including the applicant for the certificate, to show cause within 15 days from the date the notice is mailed why it should not issue and deliver the certificate to the person indicated in the notice of lien filed by the lienholder whose name appears in the application as the first lienholder without showing any lien or liens as outstanding other than those appearing in the application or those which may have been filed subsequent to the filing of the application for the certificate. If, within the 15-day period, any person other than the lienholder shown in the application or a party filing a subsequent lien, in answer to such notice to show cause, appears in person or by a representative, or responds in writing, and files a written statement under oath that his or her lien on that particular vehicle is still outstanding, the department shall not issue the certificate to anyone until after such conflict has been settled by the lien claimants involved or by a court of competent jurisdiction. If the conflict is not settled amicably within 10 days of the final date for filing an answer to the notice to show cause, the complaining party shall have 10 days to obtain a ruling, or a stay order, from a court of competent jurisdiction; if no ruling or stay order is issued and served on the department within the 10-day period, it shall issue the certificate showing no liens except those shown in the application or thereafter filed to the original applicant if there are no liens shown in the application and none are thereafter filed, or to the person indicated in the notice of lien filed by the lienholder whose name appears in the application as the first lienholder if there are liens shown in the application or thereafter filed. A duplicate certificate or corrected certificate shall only show such lien or liens as were shown in the application and subsequently filed liens that may be outstanding.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the owner of the motor vehicle or mobile home, as shown on the title certificate, or the director of the state child support enforcement program, or the director’s designee, desires to place a second or subsequent lien or encumbrance against the motor vehicle or mobile home when the title certificate is in the possession of the first lienholder, the owner shall send a written request to the first lienholder by certified mail, and such first lienholder shall forward the certificate to the department for endorsement. If the title certificate is in the possession of the owner, the owner shall forward the certificate to the department for endorsement. The department shall return the certificate to either the first lienholder or to the owner, as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the first lienholder, after endorsing the second or subsequent lien on the certificate and on the duplicate. If the first lienholder or owner fails, neglects, or refuses to forward the certificate of title to the department within 10 days from the date of the owner’s or the director’s or designee’s request, the department, on the written request of the subsequent lienholder or an assignee thereof, shall demand of the first lienholder the return of such certificate for the notation of the second or subsequent lien or encumbrance.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon satisfaction of any first lien or encumbrance recorded at the department, the owner of the motor vehicle or mobile home, as shown on the title certificate, or the person satisfying the lien shall be entitled to demand and receive from the lienholder a satisfaction of the lien. If the lienholder, upon satisfaction of the lien and upon demand, fails or refuses to furnish a satisfaction thereof within 30 days after demand, he or she shall be held liable for all costs, damages, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees, lawfully incurred by the titled owner or person satisfying the lien in any suit brought in this state for cancellation of the lien. A motor vehicle dealer acquiring ownership of a motor vehicle with an outstanding purchase money lien, shall pay and satisfy the outstanding lien within 10 working days of acquiring ownership. The lienholder receiving final payment as defined in s. 674.215 shall mail or otherwise deliver a lien satisfaction and the certificate of title indicating the satisfaction within 10 working days of receipt of such final payment or notify the person satisfying the lien that the title is not available within 10 working days of receipt of such final payment. If the lienholder is unable to provide the certificate of title and notifies the person of such, the lienholder shall provide a lien satisfaction and shall be responsible for the cost of a duplicate title, including fast title charges as provided in s. 319.323. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to electronic transactions pursuant to subsection (9).</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If, upon receipt of a title certificate showing satisfaction of the first lien, the department determines from its records that there are no subsequent liens or encumbrances upon the motor vehicle or mobile home, the department shall forward to the owner, as shown on the face of the title, a corrected certificate showing no liens or encumbrances. If there is a subsequent lien not being discharged, the certificate of title shall be reissued showing the second or subsequent lienholder as the first lienholder and shall be delivered to either the new first lienholder or to the owner as indicated in the notice of lien filed by the new first lienholder. If the certificate of title is to be retained by the first lienholder on the reissued certificate, the first lienholder shall be entitled to retain the certificate of title except as provided in subsection (4) until his or her lien is satisfied. Upon satisfaction of the lien, the lienholder shall be subject to the procedures required of a first lienholder by subsection (4) and this subsection.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any requirements in this section or in s. 319.27 indicating that a lien on a motor vehicle or mobile home shall be noted on the face of the Florida certificate of title, if there are one or more liens or encumbrances on the motor vehicle or mobile home, the department shall electronically transmit the lien to the first lienholder and notify the first lienholder of any additional liens. Subsequent lien satisfactions shall be electronically transmitted to the department and must include the name and address of the person or entity satisfying the lien. When electronic transmission of liens and lien satisfactions is used, the issuance of a certificate of title may be waived until the last lien is satisfied and a clear certificate of title is issued to the owner of the vehicle. In subsequent transfer of ownership of the motor vehicle, it shall be presumed that the motor vehicle title is subject to a lien as set forth in s. 319.225(6)(a) until the title to be issued pursuant to this subsection is received by the person or entity satisfying the lien.</Text>
