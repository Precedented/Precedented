Ten days after receipt of the motor vehicle derelict certificate application, the department may remove the lien from its records if a written statement protesting removal of the lien is not received by the department from the lienholder within the 10-day period. However, if the lienholder files with the department and the licensed salvage motor vehicle dealer within the 10-day period a written statement that the lien is still outstanding, the department shall not remove the lien and shall place an administrative hold on the record for 30 days to allow the lienholder to apply for title to the vehicle or a repossession certificate under s. 319.28.

				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As used in this section, a motor vehicle or mobile home is a “total loss”:</Text>
					<SubSubParagraph Id="a">
						<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When an insurance company pays the vehicle owner to replace the wrecked or damaged vehicle with one of like kind and quality or when an insurance company pays the owner upon the theft of the motor vehicle or mobile home; or</Text>
					</SubSubParagraph>
					<SubSubParagraph Id="b">
						<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When an uninsured motor vehicle or mobile home is wrecked or damaged and the cost, at the time of loss, of repairing or rebuilding the vehicle is 80 percent or more of the cost to the owner of replacing the wrecked or damaged motor vehicle or mobile home with one of like kind and quality.</Text>
					</SubSubParagraph>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A motor vehicle or mobile home shall not be considered a “total loss” if the insurance company and owner of a motor vehicle or mobile home agree to repair, rather than to replace, the motor vehicle or mobile home. However, if the actual cost to repair the motor vehicle or mobile home to the insurance company exceeds 100 percent of the cost of replacing the wrecked or damaged motor vehicle or mobile home with one of like kind and quality, the owner shall forward to the department, within 72 hours after the agreement, a request to brand the certificate of title with the words “Total Loss Vehicle.” Such a brand shall become a part of the vehicle’s title history.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The owner, including persons who are self-insured, of any motor vehicle or mobile home which is considered to be salvage shall, within 72 hours after the motor vehicle or mobile home becomes salvage, forward the title to the motor vehicle or mobile home to the department for processing. However, an insurance company which pays money as compensation for total loss of a motor vehicle or mobile home shall obtain the certificate of title for the motor vehicle or mobile home and, within 72 hours after receiving such certificate of title, shall forward such title to the department for processing. The owner or insurance company, as the case may be, may not dispose of a vehicle or mobile home that is a total loss before it has obtained a salvage certificate of title or certificate of destruction from the department. When applying for a salvage certificate of title or certificate of destruction, the owner or insurance company must provide the department with an estimate of the costs of repairing the physical and mechanical damage suffered by the vehicle for which a salvage certificate of title or certificate of destruction is sought. If the estimated costs of repairing the physical and mechanical damage to the vehicle are equal to 80 percent or more of the current retail cost of the vehicle, as established in any official used car or used mobile home guide, the department shall declare the vehicle unrebuildable and print a certificate of destruction, which authorizes the dismantling or destruction of the motor vehicle or mobile home described therein. However, if the damaged motor vehicle is equipped with custom-lowered floors for wheelchair access or a wheelchair lift, the insurance company may, upon determining that the vehicle is repairable to a condition that is safe for operation on public roads, submit the certificate of title to the department for reissuance as a salvage rebuildable title and the addition of a title brand of “insurance-declared total loss.” The certificate of destruction shall be reassignable a maximum of two times before dismantling or destruction of the vehicle shall be required, and shall accompany the motor vehicle or mobile home for which it is issued, when such motor vehicle or mobile home is sold for such purposes, in lieu of a certificate of title, and, thereafter, the department shall refuse issuance of any certificate of title for that vehicle. Nothing in this subsection shall be applicable when a vehicle is worth less than $1,500 retail in undamaged condition in any official used motor vehicle guide or used mobile home guide or when a stolen motor vehicle or mobile home is recovered in substantially intact condition and is readily resalable without extensive repairs to or replacement of the frame or engine. Any person who knowingly violates this paragraph or falsifies any document to avoid the requirements of this paragraph commits a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.</Text>
