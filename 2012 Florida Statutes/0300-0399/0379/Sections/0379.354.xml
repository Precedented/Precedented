	<Note Reference="1">
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Section 51, ch. 2009-86, provides that “[b]eginning in the 2009-2010 fiscal year and continuing each fiscal year thereafter, the sum of $185,000 is appropriated from the State Game Trust Fund to the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for the costs associated with the shoreline fishing license exemption pursuant to s. 379.354(4)(k), Florida Statutes.” The amendment to s. 379.354 by s. 36, ch. 2009-86, did not, in its final form, create s. 379.354(4)(k) relating to a license exemption for shoreline fishing. However, s. 4, ch. 2009-65, did create s. 379.354(4)(k) and does contain language that may relate to this subject.</Text>
