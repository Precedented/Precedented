The annual fee for issuance or renewal of a license or permit under this paragraph for reptiles of concern is initially set at $100. However, the commission may reduce that annual fee by rule if the commission determines that there is general compliance with ss. 379.305, 379.372, 379.373, and 379.374 and that such compliance allows for a reduction in fees to cover the costs of administering and enforcing the reptiles of concern program. The commission may issue a license or permit to an applicant who holds a current and valid license or permit for venomous reptiles under paragraph (a) and meets all requirements for the capturing, keeping, possessing, or exhibiting of reptiles of concern, but shall not require payment of an additional annual fee.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Such permits or licenses may be revoked by the commission upon violation of any of the provisions of ss. 379.305, 379.372, 379.373, and 379.374 or upon violation of any of the rules and regulations prescribed by the commission relating to the capturing, keeping, possessing, and exhibiting of any venomous reptiles or reptiles of concern.
