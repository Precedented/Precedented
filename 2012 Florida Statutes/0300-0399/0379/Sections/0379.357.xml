The tags shall be nontransferable, except that the commission may allow for a limited number of tags to be purchased by professional fishing guides for transfer to individuals, and issued by the commission in order of receipt of a properly completed application for a nonrefundable fee of $50 per tag. The commission and any tax collector may sell the tags and collect the fees therefor. Tarpon tags are valid from July 1 through June 30. Before August 15 of each year, each tax collector shall submit to the commission all unissued tags for the previous fiscal year along with a written audit report, on forms prescribed or approved by the commission, as to the numbers of the unissued tags.
