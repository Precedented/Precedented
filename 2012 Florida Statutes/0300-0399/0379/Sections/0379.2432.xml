The Legislature recognizes that strong manatee protection depends upon consistently achieving a high degree of compliance with existing and future rules. The commission shall conduct standardized studies to determine levels of public compliance with manatee protection rules, and shall use the results of the studies, together with other relevant information, to develop and implement strategic law enforcement initiatives and boater education plans. Drawing upon information obtained from the compliance studies and the implementation of enforcement initiatives together with boater education plans, the commission shall identify any impediments in consistently achieving high levels of compliance, and adjust their enforcement and boater education efforts accordingly.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 19, ch. 2002-264; s. 74, ch. 2008-247.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 370.1201.</Text></Note></Section>
