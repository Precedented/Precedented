No grant, sale or conveyance of any water bottom, except conditional leases and dispositions hereinafter provided for, shall hereafter be made by the state, the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund, the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, or any other official or political corporation. Persons who have received, or may hereafter receive permits to do business in this state, with their factories, shucking plants and shipping depots located in this state, may enjoy the right of fishing for oysters and clams from the natural reefs and bedding oysters and clams on leased bedding grounds, and shall have the right to employ such boats, vessels, or labor and assistants as they may need. Provided that no oysters shall be transported unshucked and in the shells, out of the state, except for use in what is commonly known as the “half-shell trade.” When the oyster meats have been separated from the shells it shall be permissible to ship the meats out of the state for further processing and for canning or packing. It shall be unlawful to transport oysters out of the state, unshucked and in the shells, for processing or packing.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">CONTROL.<EmDash />The Department of Environmental Protection has exclusive power and control over all water bottoms, not held under some grant or alienation heretofore made, including such as may revert to the state by cancellation or otherwise, and may lease the same to any person irrespective of residence or citizenship, upon such terms, conditions and restrictions as said division may elect to impose, without limitation as to area to any one person, for the purpose of granting exclusive right to plant oysters or clams thereon and for the purpose of fishing, taking, catching, bedding and raising oysters, clams and other shellfish.
