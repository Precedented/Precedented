Space Florida is not required to pay any taxes on any project or any other property owned by Space Florida under this act or upon the income therefrom. The bonds issued under this act or upon the income therefrom (including any profit made on the sale thereof), and all notes, mortgages, security agreements, letters of credit, or other instruments which arise out of or are given to secure the repayment of bonds issued in connection with a project financed under this act, shall at all times be free from taxation by the state or any local unit, political subdivision, or other instrumentality of the state. This section, however, does not exempt from taxation or assessments the leasehold interest of a lessee in any project or any other property or interest owned by the lessee. The exemption granted by this section is not applicable to any tax imposed by chapter 220 on interest, income, or profits on debt obligations owned by corporations.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 91-265; s. 46, ch. 2006-60.</History></Section>
