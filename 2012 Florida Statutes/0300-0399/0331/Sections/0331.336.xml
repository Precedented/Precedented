Such notes shall be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate or rates, mature at such time or times, be renewable for such additional term or terms, and be in such form and executed in such manner as the board shall prescribe. Such notes may be sold at public sale, or if such notes shall be renewable notes, may be exchanged for notes then outstanding on such terms as the board shall determine. Such notes shall be paid from the proceeds of such bonds when issued. The board may in its discretion, in lieu of retiring the notes by means of bonds, retire them by means of current revenues or from any assessments levied for the payment of such bonds, but in such event a like amount of the bonds authorized shall not be issued.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 40, 61, ch. 89-300; ss. 7, 8, ch. 90-192; s. 33, ch. 2006-60.</History></Section>
