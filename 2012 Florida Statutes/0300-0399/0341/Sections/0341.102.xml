		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except for contract agreements awarded pursuant to chapter 427, a county, as defined in s. 125.011(1), or a local governmental entity located within such a county, may not unduly restrict or impose any economic regulation upon any private sector contract transportation agreement. A private sector contract transportation agreement is a prearranged written contract between a bus owner and a public sector or private sector entity for the prearranged transportation of specific passengers, not including street hails, by a nonpublic sector bus over public roads that do not overlap public transportation corridors by more than 70 percent; provided, such passengers are employees, patients, or clients of the public sector or private sector entity, and such entity has a legitimate business or governmental purpose in transporting such employees, patients, or clients; and such entity’s primary business is not transportation of passengers by motor vehicle, as defined in s. 320.01. For the purpose of this subsection, a nonpublic sector bus is defined as a vehicle designed for carrying more than 10 passengers. A public transportation corridor consists of those public roads within one-quarter mile of, and including, existing public transportation routes. Nothing contained in this subsection shall restrict local governmental entities from enacting necessary safety, insurance, and traffic ordinances.</Text>
