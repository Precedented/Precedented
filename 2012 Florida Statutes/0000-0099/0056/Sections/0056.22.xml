Property not effectively disposed of at the initial sheriff’s sale may be readvertised, as provided in s. 56.21, upon receipt of an additional deposit to cover costs incurred in connection with the maintenance of the property under legal process. In the event no additional deposit is received by the sheriff, the property may be returned to the defendant; if the defendant refuses to accept such property, the property may be returned to a third party, such as a lienholder, upon presentation of a proper court order directing such return. If none of the above can be accomplished, such property shall be disposed of as unclaimed or abandoned.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 3256, 1881; RS 1203; GS 1632; RGS 2836; CGL 4523; s. 1, ch. 61-104; s. 11, ch. 67-254; s. 5, ch. 82-118; s. 7, ch. 87-405; s. 11, ch. 94-170.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 55.45.</Text></Note></Section>
