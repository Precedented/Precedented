The court shall pass on the question of illegality as soon as possible. If the execution is adjudged illegal in any part, the court shall stay it as to the part but if it is adjudged legal in whole or in part, the court shall enter judgment against the principal and surety on such bond for the amount of so much of the execution as is adjudged to be legal and execution shall issue thereon.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 2, 3, Feb. 15, 1834; RS 1195; GS 1624; RGS 2828; CGL 4515; s. 11, ch. 67-254.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 55.37.</Text></Note></Section>
