The unique identifier must be the same for that person in any court case. To create the unique identifier, the court may collect a portion of the person’s social security number or other personal identification information, such as the person’s date of birth. Failure to provide a social security number for this purpose may not be grounds to deny any services, rights, or remedies otherwise provided by law. To implement a unique identifier, the Supreme Court may require the revision of only those information technology systems that are directly operated and funded by the state court system.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2005-239.</History></Section>
