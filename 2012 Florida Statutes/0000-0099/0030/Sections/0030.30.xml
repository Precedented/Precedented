The judge of such court, after due notice to all parties in interest, shall determine whether or not such property is subject to levy under the writ. Any party aggrieved by such ruling, including the sheriff, may appeal therefrom, as from a final decree in a chancery cause, and may have a supersedeas upon such terms and conditions as the judge shall fix. In the event the property is ultimately held to be subject to the writ, the plaintiff’s writ shall have priority over any writs levied subsequent to the date upon which the plaintiff’s writ was delivered to the sheriff.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">No sheriff shall be liable for making any levy pursuant to the specific order of a court of competent jurisdiction.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ch. 22019, 1943; s. 3, ch. 77-234; s. 27, ch. 81-259; s. 2, ch. 82-118; s. 186, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
