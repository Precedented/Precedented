When a sheriff is appointed to fill a vacancy, a bond may not be a prerequisite to succession in office; however, if the county commission requires a bond for the office of sheriff, the commission shall allow a period of 10 days after the effective date of the appointment in which the bond may be provided.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 4, ch. 3724, 1887; RS 1237; GS 1666; RGS 2871; CGL 4568; s. 1, ch. 17754, 1937; ss. 10, 12, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 172, ch. 95-147; s. 15, ch. 95-312; s. 11, ch. 98-34.</History></Section>
