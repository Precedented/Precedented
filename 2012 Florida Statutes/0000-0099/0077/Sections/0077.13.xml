The officer shall sell garnishee’s property as under other executions. Garnishee may release his or her property from the levy and sale by surrendering the property of defendant to the officer levying the execution at the time appointed for the sale of garnishee’s property so levied on, or at any time before the day of the sale and by paying the costs of the proceedings to sell up to the time of the surrender.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 43, 1845; RS 1675; GS 2139; RGS 3441; CGL 5294; s. 27, ch. 67-254; s. 393, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
