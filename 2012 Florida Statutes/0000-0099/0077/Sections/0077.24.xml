On the approval of the bond the court shall discharge the garnishment and release the property. The order shall become effective on its filing with the bond. If garnishee admits a debt to or possession of property of defendant in excess of a sum sufficient to satisfy plaintiff’s claim, on motion of defendant and notice to plaintiff, the court shall release garnishee from responsibility to plaintiff for any debt to or property of defendant except in a sum deemed by the court sufficient to satisfy plaintiff’s claim with interest and costs.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">RS 1685; GS 2150; s. 1, ch. 5906, 1909; s. 2, ch. 6910, 1915; RGS 3452; CGL 5305; s. 27, ch. 67-254; s. 399, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
