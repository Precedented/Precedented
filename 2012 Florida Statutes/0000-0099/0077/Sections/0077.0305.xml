<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0077.0305" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Continuing writ of garnishment against salary or wages.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if salary or wages are to be garnished to satisfy a judgment, the court shall issue a continuing writ of garnishment to the judgment debtor’s employer which provides for the periodic payment of a portion of the salary or wages of the judgment debtor as the salary or wages become due until the judgment is satisfied or until otherwise provided by court order. A debtor’s status as an employee of the state or its agencies or political subdivisions does not preclude a judgment creditor’s right to garnish the debtor’s wages. For the purposes of this section, the state includes the judicial branch and the legislative branch as defined in s. 216.011. The state, for itself and for its agencies and subdivisions, waives sovereign immunity for the express and limited purpose necessary to carry out this section. The court shall allow the judgment debtor’s employer to collect up to $5 against the salary or wages of the judgment debtor to reimburse the employer for administrative costs for the first deduction from the judgment debtor’s salary or wages and up to $2 for each deduction thereafter. The funds collected by the state under this section must be deposited in the Department of Financial Services Administrative Trust Fund for purposes of carrying out this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 88-295; s. 2, ch. 93-69; s. 1, ch. 93-256; s. 107, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
