In determining an owner of record, a person need not perform a title search and examination but may rely on the plaintiff’s allegation of ownership in the complaint when determining the owner of record.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Subordinate lienholder” means the holder of a subordinate lien shown on the face of the pleadings as an encumbrance on the property. The lien held by the party filing the foreclosure lawsuit is not a subordinate lien. A subordinate lienholder includes, but is not limited to, a subordinate mortgage, judgment, tax warrant, assessment lien, or construction lien. However, the holder of a subordinate lien shall not be deemed a subordinate lienholder if the holder was paid in full from the proceeds of the sale.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Surplus funds” or “surplus” means the funds remaining after payment of all disbursements required by the final judgment of foreclosure and shown on the certificate of disbursements.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Surplus trustee” means a person qualifying as a surplus trustee pursuant to s. 45.034.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">There is established a rebuttable legal presumption that the owner of record on the date of the filing of a lis pendens is the person entitled to surplus funds after payment of subordinate lienholders who have timely filed a claim. A person claiming a legal right to the surplus as an assignee of the rights of the owner of record must prove to the court that such person is entitled to the funds. At any hearing regarding such entitlement, the court shall consider the factors set forth in s. 45.033 in determining whether an assignment is sufficient to overcome the presumption. It is the intent of the Legislature to abrogate the common law rule that surplus proceeds in a foreclosure case are the property of the owner of the property on the date of the foreclosure sale.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">During the 60 days after the clerk issues a certificate of disbursements, the clerk shall hold the surplus pending a court order.</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the owner of record claims the surplus during the 60-day period and there is no subordinate lienholder, the court shall order the clerk to deduct any applicable service charges from the surplus and pay the remainder to the owner of record. The clerk may establish a reasonable requirement that the owner of record prove his or her identity before receiving the disbursement. The clerk may assist an owner of record in making a claim.

At the evidentiary hearing, an equity assignee has the burden of proving that he or she is entitled to some or all of the surplus funds. The court may grant summary judgment to a subordinate lienholder prior to or at the evidentiary hearing.
