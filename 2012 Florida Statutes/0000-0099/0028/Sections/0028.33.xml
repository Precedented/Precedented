No clerk investing such funds shall be liable for the loss of any interest when circumstances require the withdrawal of funds placed in a time deposit and needed for immediate payment of county obligations. Except for interest earned on moneys deposited in the registry of the court, all interest accruing from moneys deposited shall be deemed income of the county and may be expended as receipts of the county as approved by the board of county commissioners pursuant to chapter 129. The clerk may invest moneys deposited in the registry of the court and shall retain as income of the office of the clerk and as a reasonable investment management fee 10 percent of the interest accruing on those funds with the balance of such interest being allocated in accordance with the interest of the depositors.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 73-282; s. 1, ch. 82-117; s. 166, ch. 95-147; s. 7, ch. 2000-264; s. 6, ch. 2009-61.</History></Section>
