The purpose of the electronic filing process is to reduce judicial costs in the office of the clerk and the judiciary, increase timeliness in the processing of cases, and provide the judiciary with case-related information to allow for improved judicial case management. The Legislature requests that, no later than July 1, 2009, the Supreme Court set statewide standards for electronic filing to be used by the clerks of court to implement electronic filing. The standards should specify the required information for the duties of the clerks of court and the judiciary for case management. The clerks of court shall begin implementation no later than October 1, 2009. The Florida Clerks of Court Operations Corporation shall report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by March 1, 2010, on the status of implementing electronic filing. The report shall include the detailed status of each clerk office’s implementation of an electronic filing process, and for those clerks who have not fully implemented electronic filing by March 1, 2010, a description of the additional steps needed and a projected timeline for full implementation. Revenues provided to counties and the clerk of court under s. 28.24(12)(e) for information technology may also be used to implement electronic filing processes.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 16, ch. 2009-61.</History></Section>
