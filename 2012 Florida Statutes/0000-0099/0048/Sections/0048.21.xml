The return-of-service form must be signed by the person who effects the service of process. However, a person employed by a sheriff who effects the service of process may sign the return-of-service form using an electronic signature certified by the sheriff.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A failure to state the facts or to include the signature required by subsection (1) invalidates the service, but the return is amendable to state the facts or to include the signature at any time on application to the court from which the process issued. On amendment, service is as effective as if the return had originally stated the omitted facts or included the signature. A failure to state all the facts in or to include the signature on the return shall subject the person effecting service to a fine not exceeding $10, in the court’s discretion.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 18, Nov. 23, 1828; RS 1026; GS 1414; RGS 2612; CGL 4276; s. 4, ch. 67-254; s. 4, ch. 94-170; s. 1356, ch. 95-147; s. 3, ch. 2004-273; s. 5, ch. 2011-159.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 47.47.</Text></Note></Section>
