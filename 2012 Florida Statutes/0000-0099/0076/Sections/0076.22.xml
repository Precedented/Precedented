When the property attached is perishable or liable to great deterioration in value or the costs of keeping it are greatly disproportionate to its value, the court may order the sale of the property after such notice as is expedient, and the proceeds of the sale shall be paid into court and abide the judgment.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 12, Feb. 17, 1833; RS 1655; GS 2119; RGS 3420; CGL 5273; s. 26, ch. 67-254; s. 380, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
