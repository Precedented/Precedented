Levies on the same property under successive attachments have precedence as liens in the order in which they are made. A levy binds real estate as against subsequent creditors or purchasers only from the time of the record by the clerk of the circuit court of a notice of the levy and a description of the property levied on.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 9, Feb. 17, 1833; RS 1651; GS 2115; RGS 3416; CGL 5269; s. 26, ch. 67-254.</History></Section>
