In foreclosure of a mortgage on personal property if the motion states that the property or part of it has been disposed of without the consent of the party holding the mortgage and that plaintiff does not know who has the property or part of it, the bond shall be made payable to the state for the use and benefit of all parties interested, conditioned to pay all costs and damages which are sustained in consequence of plaintiff’s improperly suing out the attachment. Any party aggrieved may sue on the bond but the state is not liable for any costs, damages, or expenses that are incurred. Any bond in attachment is not void as against the obligors, nor are they discharged therefrom on account of any informality, although the attachment is dissolved because of the informality.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 10, Feb. 15, 1834; RS 1646; GS 2110; RGS 3411; s. 2, ch. 8477, 1921; CGL 5264; s. 26, ch. 67-254; s. 375, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
