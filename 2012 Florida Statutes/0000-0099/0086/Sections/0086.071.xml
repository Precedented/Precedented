<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0086.071" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Jury trials.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When an action under this chapter concerns the determination of an issue of fact, the issue may be tried as issues of fact are tried in other civil actions in the court in which the proceeding is pending. To settle questions of fact necessary to be determined before judgment can be rendered, the court may direct their submission to a jury. When a declaration of right or the granting of further relief based thereon concerns the determination of issues of fact triable by a jury, the issues may be submitted to a jury in the form of interrogatories, with proper instructions by the court, whether a general verdict is required or not. Neither this section nor any other section of this chapter shall be construed as requiring a jury to determine issues of fact in chancery actions.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 21820, 1943; s. 38, ch. 67-254.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 87.08.</Text></Note></Section>
