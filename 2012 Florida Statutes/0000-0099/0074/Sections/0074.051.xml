The court may make such orders in respect of encumbrances, liens, rents, taxes, assessments, insurance, amount of the good faith deposit, and other charges, if any, as shall be just and equitable. If the court finds that the petitioner is entitled to possession of the property prior to final judgment, it shall enter an order requiring the petitioner to deposit in the registry of the court such sum of money as will fully secure and fully compensate the persons entitled to compensation as ultimately determined by the final judgment. Said deposit shall not be less than the amount of the petitioner’s estimate of value, if the petitioner be the state or any agency thereof, any county, the city, or other public body; otherwise, double the amount of petitioner’s estimate of value.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a defendant requests a hearing pursuant to s. 74.041(3) and the petitioner is an electric utility that is seeking to appropriate property necessary for an electric generation plant, an associated facility of an electric generation plant, an electric substation, or a power line, it is the intent of the Legislature that the court, when practicable, conduct the hearing no more than 120 days after the petition is filed and issue its order of taking no more than 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The court may fix the time within which and the terms upon which the defendants shall be required to surrender possession to the petitioner, which time of possession shall be upon deposit for those defendants failing to file a request for hearing as provided herein.
