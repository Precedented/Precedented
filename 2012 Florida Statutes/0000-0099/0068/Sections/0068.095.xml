The Legislature finds that the lack of adequate and equitable legal services available to the indigent population, particularly the children and elderly of this state, unnecessarily burdens existing social and human services programs. It is the purpose of this act to promote the availability of civil legal assistance to the poor and improve access to justice by establishing a streamlined method to utilize available state funds in furtherance of this goal.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2002-288.</History></Section>
