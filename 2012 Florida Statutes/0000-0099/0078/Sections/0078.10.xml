However, if the sheriff does not have reasonable grounds to believe that the property to be replevied is secreted or concealed in any dwelling house or other building or enclosure, the plaintiff may petition the court for a “break order” directing the sheriff to enter physically any dwelling house or other building or enclosure. Upon a showing of probable cause by the plaintiff, the court shall enter such “break order.”</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, Mar. 11, 1845; RS 1716; GS 2180; RGS 3485; CGL 5338; s. 28, ch. 67-254; s. 1, ch. 73-20; s. 7, ch. 83-255; s. 407, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
