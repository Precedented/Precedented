			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Chief Financial Officer shall charge the state attorneys with the collection of all claims that are placed in their hands for collection of money or property for the state or any county or special district, or that it otherwise requires them to collect. The charges are evidence of indebtedness of a state attorney against whom any charge is made for the full amount of the claim, until the charges have been collected and paid into the treasury of the state or of the county or special district or the legal remedies of the state have been exhausted, or until the state attorney demonstrates to the Chief Financial Officer that the failure to collect the charges is not due to negligence and the Chief Financial Officer has made a proper entry of satisfaction of the charge against the state attorney. </Text>
