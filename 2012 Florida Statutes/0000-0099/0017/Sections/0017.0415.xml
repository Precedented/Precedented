The state, its agencies, and its subdivisions, may assign claims under such terms as are mutually acceptable to the Chief Financial Officer and the assignee and assignor. The assigned claim may be enforced as a setoff to any claim against the state, its agencies, or its subdivisions, by garnishment or in the same manner as a judgment in a civil action. Claims against the state, its agencies, and its subdivisions resulting from the condemnation of property protected by the provisions of s. 4, Art. X of the State Constitution are not subject to setoff pursuant to this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 91-209; s. 21, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
