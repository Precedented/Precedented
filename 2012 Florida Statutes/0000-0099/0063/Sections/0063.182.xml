A showing of an indirect, inconsequential, or contingent interest is wholly inadequate, and a person with this indirect interest lacks standing to set aside a judgment of adoption.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This subsection is remedial and shall apply to all adoptions, including those in which a judgment of adoption has already been entered.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 18, ch. 73-159; s. 6, ch. 2000-188; s. 32, ch. 2003-58; s. 32, ch. 2003-154; s. 4, ch. 2006-265.</History></Section>
