A judgment terminating parental rights pending adoption is voidable and any later judgment of adoption of that minor is voidable if, upon a parent’s motion for relief from judgment, the court finds that the adoption substantially fails to meet the requirements of this chapter. The motion must be filed within a reasonable time, but not later than 1 year after the date the judgment terminating parental rights was entered.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 14, ch. 73-159; s. 3, ch. 77-140; s. 26, ch. 2001-3; s. 28, ch. 2003-58; s. 20, ch. 2008-151.</History></Section>
