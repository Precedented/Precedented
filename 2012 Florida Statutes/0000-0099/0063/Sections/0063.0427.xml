The court shall consider the following in making such determination:</Text>

			</Paragraph>
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">If the court determines that the child’s best interests will be served by postadoption communication or contact, the court shall so order, stating the nature and frequency of the communication or contact. This order shall be made a part of the final adoption order, but the continuing validity of the adoption may not be contingent upon such postadoption communication or contact and the ability of the adoptive parents and child to change residence within or outside the State of Florida may not be impaired by such communication or contact.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding s. 63.162, the adoptive parent may, at any time, petition for review of a communication or contact order entered pursuant to subsection (1), if the adoptive parent believes that the best interests of the adopted child are being compromised, and the court may order the communication or contact to be terminated or modified, as the court deems to be in the best interests of the adopted child; however, the court may not increase contact between the adopted child and siblings, birth parents, or other relatives without the consent of the adoptive parent or parents. As part of the review process, the court may order the parties to engage in mediation. The department shall not be required to be a party to such review.</Text>
