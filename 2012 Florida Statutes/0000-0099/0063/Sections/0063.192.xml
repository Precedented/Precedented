A judgment or decree of a court or authorized body terminating the relationship of a parent and child, whether independent, incorporated in an adoption decree, or incorporated in a legal guardianship order issued pursuant to due process of law of any other jurisdiction within or without the United States, shall be deemed to effectively terminate parental rights for purposes of a proceeding on a petition for adoption in this state. If a minor child has been made available for adoption in a foreign state or foreign country and the parental rights of the minor child’s parent have been terminated or the child has been declared to be abandoned or orphaned, no additional termination of parental rights proceeding need occur, and the adoption may be finalized according to the procedures set forth in this chapter.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 19, ch. 73-159; s. 21, ch. 2008-151.</History></Section>
