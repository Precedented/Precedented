Such question may be answered by stipulation or other appropriate means, including, but not limited to, additional testimony upon such terms and limitations as the court prescribes. If the court determines that the juror’s question calls for inadmissible evidence, the question shall not be read or answered. If the court rejects a juror’s question, the court should tell the jury that trial rules do not permit some questions and that the jurors should not attach any significance to the failure of having their question asked.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The court may give final instructions to the jury before closing arguments of counsel to enhance jurors’ ability to apply the law to the facts.
