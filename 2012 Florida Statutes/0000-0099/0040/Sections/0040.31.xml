In such case, each county shall be paid by warrant, issued by the Chief Financial Officer, only the amount so apportioned to each county, and, when the amount so apportioned is insufficient to pay in full all the witnesses during a quarterly fiscal period, the clerk of the court shall apportion the money received pro rata among the witnesses entitled to pay and shall give to each witness a certificate of the amount of compensation still due, which certificate shall be held by the commission as other demands against the state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 4121, 1893; GS 1593; s. 3, ch. 7262, 1917; RGS 2795; CGL 4481; s. 3, ch. 65-483; s. 4, ch. 68-7; s. 9, ch. 73-334; s. 14, ch. 79-235; s. 254, ch. 95-147; s. 19, ch. 95-312; s. 94, ch. 2003-261; s. 17, ch. 2008-111.</History></Section>
