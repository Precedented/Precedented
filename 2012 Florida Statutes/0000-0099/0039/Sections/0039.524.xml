			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except as provided in s. 39.407 or s. 985.801, a dependent child 6 years of age or older who has been found to be a victim of sexual exploitation as defined in s. 39.01(67)(g) must be assessed for placement in a safe house as provided in s. 409.1678. The assessment shall be conducted by the department or its agent and shall incorporate and address current and historical information from any law enforcement reports; psychological testing or evaluation that has occurred; current and historical information from the guardian ad litem, if one has been assigned; current and historical information from any current therapist, teacher, or other professional who has knowledge of the child and has worked with the child; and any other information concerning the availability and suitability of safe-house placement. If such placement is determined to be appropriate as a result of this assessment, the child may be placed in a safe house, if one is available. As used in this section, the term “available” as it relates to a placement means a placement that is located within the circuit or otherwise reasonably accessible.</Text>
