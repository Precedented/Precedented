If it appears on the application that there is danger that the principal may dispose of his or her property before final judgment so that there will not be sufficient property of the principal to satisfy any judgment that is rendered against the administrator, executor, guardian or trustee, the court shall issue an injunction on such terms as are proper, enjoining such principal from disposing of his or her property, or so much thereof as is necessary for the protection of the surety until the final disposition of the action. It is not necessary for the surety to show that any amounts are due by said administrator, executor, guardian or trustee but the judge granting the injunction may vacate it on the executor, administrator, guardian or trustee giving adequate security, to be approved by the court, to the surety conditioned to save him or her harmless for all loss or damage he or she sustains as surety.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 5406, 1905; RGS 3183; CGL 4975; s. 15, ch. 67-254; s. 317, ch. 95-147.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 64.10.</Text></Note></Section>
