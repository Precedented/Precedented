		<Text xml:space="preserve">The state attorney of each judicial circuit is authorized to employ any municipal or county police officer or sheriff’s deputy as an investigator for the state attorney’s office with full powers of arrest throughout the judicial circuit provided such investigator serves on a special task force to investigate matters involving criminal activity the detection of which might benefit from a special task force and provided further that the salary of such municipal or county police officer or sheriff’s deputy shall be paid by the city, county, or sheriff by which the investigator is principally employed, and with the consent of the county, sheriff, or municipality. The arrest powers granted in this section may be exercised only in the furtherance of the conduct of the business of the special task force to which such municipal or county police officer or sheriff’s deputy is assigned by the state attorney.</Text>
