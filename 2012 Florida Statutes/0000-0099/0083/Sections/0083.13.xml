If the property is in another jurisdiction, the party who had the writ issued shall deliver the writ to the sheriff in the other jurisdiction; and that sheriff shall execute the writ, upon order of the court, by levying on the property and delivering it to the sheriff of the county in which the action is pending, to be disposed of according to law, unless he or she is ordered by the court from which the writ emanated to hold the property and dispose of it in his or her jurisdiction according to law. If the plaintiff shows by a sworn statement that the defendant cannot be found within the state, the levy on the property suffices as service on the defendant.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 3721, 1887; RS 1765; GS 2241; RGS 3560; CGL 5424; s. 34, ch. 67-254; s. 3, ch. 80-282; s. 15, ch. 82-66; s. 8, ch. 83-255; s. 433, ch. 95-147; s. 5, ch. 2004-273.</History></Section>
