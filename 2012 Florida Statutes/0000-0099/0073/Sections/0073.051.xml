If a defendant does not file his or her defenses on or before the return date, defaults may be entered against the defendant, but nothing shall prevent any person who is shown by the record to be interested in the property from appearing before the jury to claim the amount of compensation that he or she conceives to be due for the property.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-369; s. 1, ch. 70-285; s. 27, ch. 73-333; s. 360, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
