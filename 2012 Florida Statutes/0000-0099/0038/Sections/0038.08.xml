The fact that an order was entered by a judge who is subsequently disqualified under s. 38.02 or s. 38.05, shall not be assignable as error subject to review by the appropriate appellate court unless a petition for reconsideration as provided for in s. 38.07, was filed by the party urging the matter as error, and the judge before whom the cause was then pending refused to vacate or modify said order.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 9, ch. 16053, 1933; CGL 1936 Supp. 4155(8); s. 6, ch. 63-559.</History></Section>
