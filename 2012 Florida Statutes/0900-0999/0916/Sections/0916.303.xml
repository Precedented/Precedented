The charges may be refiled by the state if the defendant is declared competent to proceed in the future.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the charges are dismissed and if the defendant is considered to lack sufficient capacity to give express and informed consent to a voluntary application for services and lacks the basic survival and self-care skills to provide for his or her well-being or is likely to physically injure himself or herself or others if allowed to remain at liberty, the agency, the state attorney, or the defendant’s attorney shall apply to the committing court to involuntarily admit the defendant to residential services pursuant to s. 393.11.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the defendant is considered to need involuntary residential services for reasons described in subsection (2) and, further, there is a substantial likelihood that the defendant will injure another person or continues to present a danger of escape, and all available less restrictive alternatives, including services in community residential facilities or other community settings, which would offer an opportunity for improvement of the condition have been judged to be inappropriate, the agency, the state attorney, or the defendant’s counsel may request the committing court to continue the defendant’s placement in a secure facility pursuant to this part. Any placement so continued under this subsection must be reviewed by the court at least annually at a hearing. The annual review and hearing shall determine whether the defendant continues to meet the criteria described in this subsection and, if so, whether the defendant still requires involuntary placement in a secure facility and whether the defendant is receiving adequate care, treatment, habilitation, and rehabilitation, including psychotropic medication and behavioral programming. Notice of the annual review and review hearing shall be given to the state attorney and the defendant’s attorney. In no instance may a defendant’s placement in a secure facility exceed the maximum sentence for the crime for which the defendant was charged.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 27, ch. 98-92; s. 56, ch. 99-7; s. 21, ch. 2006-195.</History></Section>
