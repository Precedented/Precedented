The court may commit the defendant to custody or admit him or her to bail for a reasonable period of time to await a requisition for his or her extradition. If a requisition is not received within the time set by the court, the defendant shall be discharged. If the defendant has been admitted to bail, the court shall order the bond canceled and any deposit of money or bonds returned.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 208, ch. 19554, 1939; CGL 1940 Supp. 8663(216); s. 112, ch. 70-339; s. 1536, ch. 97-102.</History></Section>
