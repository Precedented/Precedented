Any matters which might be set forth in an answer or other pleading may be pleaded orally before the court. An answer admitting the allegations of the petition may be filed by the child joined by a parent or the child’s counsel. The answer must acknowledge that the child has been advised of the right to counsel, of the right to remain silent, and of the possible dispositions available to the court. It shall provide for a waiver of the adjudicatory hearing, a statement of consent to an order of adjudication, and an authorization for the court to proceed with a disposition hearing. Upon the filing of such an order, a disposition hearing shall be set at the earliest practicable time that will allow for the completion of the assessment and classification process resulting in the predisposition report.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 90-208; s. 222, ch. 95-147; s. 30, ch. 97-238; s. 42, ch. 2006-120.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 39.051; s. 985.222.</Text></Note></Section>
