The appeal must be taken before the adjudicatory hearing.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An appeal by the state from a preadjudicatory hearing order shall stay the case against a child upon whose application the order was made until the appeal is determined. If the court from which the appeal is taken determines that the evidence, confession, or admission that is the subject of the order would materially assist the state in proving its case against another child and that the prosecuting attorney intends to use it for that purpose, the court shall stay the case of that child until the appeal is determined. The trial court in its discretion may release a child whose case is stayed pending appeal. A child who is not released from custody pending appeal may petition the appellate court for expedited consideration of the appeal.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 90-208; s. 43, ch. 97-238; s. 68, ch. 2006-120.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 39.0711; s. 985.235.</Text></Note></Section>
