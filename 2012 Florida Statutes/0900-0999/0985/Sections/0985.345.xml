However, if the state attorney believes that the facts and circumstances of the case suggest the child’s involvement in the dealing and selling of controlled substances, the court shall hold a preadmission hearing. If the state attorney establishes by a preponderance of the evidence at such hearing that the child was involved in the dealing and selling of controlled substances, the court shall deny the child’s admission into a delinquency pretrial intervention program.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">While enrolled in a delinquency pretrial intervention program authorized by this section, a child is subject to a coordinated strategy developed by a drug court team under s. 397.334(4). The coordinated strategy may include a protocol of sanctions that may be imposed upon the child for noncompliance with program rules. The protocol of sanctions may include, but is not limited to, placement in a substance abuse treatment program offered by a licensed service provider as defined in s. 397.311 or serving a period of secure detention under this chapter. The coordinated strategy must be provided in writing to the child before the child agrees to enter the pretrial treatment-based drug court program or other pretrial intervention program. Any child whose charges are dismissed after successful completion of the treatment-based drug court program, if otherwise eligible, may have his or her arrest record and plea of nolo contendere to the dismissed charges expunged under s. 943.0585.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At the end of the delinquency pretrial intervention period, the court shall consider the recommendation of the state attorney and the program administrator as to disposition of the pending charges. The court shall determine, by written finding, whether the child has successfully completed the delinquency pretrial intervention program. Notwithstanding the coordinated strategy developed by a drug court team pursuant to s. 397.334(4), if the court finds that the child has not successfully completed the delinquency pretrial intervention program, the court may order the child to continue in an education, treatment, or urine monitoring program if resources and funding are available or order that the charges revert to normal channels for prosecution. The court may dismiss the charges upon a finding that the child has successfully completed the delinquency pretrial intervention program.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any entity, whether public or private, providing pretrial substance abuse education, treatment intervention, and a urine monitoring program under this section must contract with the county or appropriate governmental entity, and the terms of the contract must include, but need not be limited to, the requirements established for private entities under s. 948.15(3). It is the intent of the Legislature that public or private entities providing substance abuse education and treatment intervention programs involve the active participation of parents, schools, churches, businesses, law enforcement agencies, and the department or its contract providers.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 93-196; s. 37, ch. 94-209; s. 13, ch. 95-267; s. 50, ch. 97-238; s. 83, ch. 98-280; s. 10, ch. 2006-97; s. 42, ch. 2006-120; s. 8, ch. 2009-64.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 39.0475; s. 985.306.</Text></Note></Section>
