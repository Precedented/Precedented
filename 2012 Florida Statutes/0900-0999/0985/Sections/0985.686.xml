			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">By October 1, 2004, the department shall develop a methodology for determining the amount of each fiscally constrained county’s costs of detention care for juveniles, for the period of time prior to final court disposition, which must be paid by the state. At a minimum, this methodology must consider the difference between the amount appropriated to the department for offsetting the costs associated with the assignment of juvenile pretrial detention expenses to the fiscally constrained county and the total estimated costs to the fiscally constrained county, for the fiscal year, of detention care for juveniles for the period of time prior to final court disposition.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Subject to legislative appropriation and based on the methodology developed under paragraph (a), the department shall provide funding to offset the costs to fiscally constrained counties of detention care for juveniles for the period of time prior to final court disposition. If county matching funds are required by the department to eliminate the difference calculated under paragraph (a) or the difference between the actual costs of the fiscally constrained counties and the amount appropriated in small county grants for use in mitigating such costs, that match amount must be allocated proportionately among all fiscally constrained counties.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each county shall incorporate into its annual county budget sufficient funds to pay its costs of detention care for juveniles who reside in that county for the period of time prior to final court disposition. This amount shall be based upon the prior use of secure detention for juveniles who are residents of that county, as calculated by the department. Each county shall pay the estimated costs at the beginning of each month. Any difference between the estimated costs and actual costs shall be reconciled at the end of the state fiscal year.</Text>
