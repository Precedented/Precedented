If appropriate and acceptable to the victim and the victim’s parent or parents or legal guardian, the court may reflect in the written disposition order that the victim or the victim’s parent or parents or legal guardian stated in writing or in open court that he or she did not object to the offender being permitted to attend the same school or ride on the same school bus as the victim or a sibling of the victim. If applicable, the court placement or commitment order shall include a finding under this subsection.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any commitment of a delinquent child to the department must be for an indeterminate period of time, which may include periods of temporary release; however, the period of time may not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment that an adult may serve for the same offense, except that the duration of a minimum-risk nonresidential commitment for an offense that is a misdemeanor of the second degree, or is equivalent to a misdemeanor of the second degree, may be for a period not to exceed 6 months. The duration of the child’s placement in a commitment program of any restrictiveness level shall be based on objective performance-based treatment planning. The child’s treatment plan progress and adjustment-related issues shall be reported to the court quarterly, unless the court requests monthly reports. The child’s length of stay in a commitment program may be extended if the child fails to comply with or participate in treatment activities. The child’s length of stay in the program shall not be extended for purposes of sanction or punishment. Any temporary release from such program must be approved by the court. Any child so committed may be discharged from institutional confinement or a program upon the direction of the department with the concurrence of the court. The child’s treatment plan progress and adjustment-related issues must be communicated to the court at the time the department requests the court to consider releasing the child from the commitment program. The department shall give the court that committed the child to the department reasonable notice, in writing, of its desire to discharge the child from a commitment facility. The court that committed the child may thereafter accept or reject the request. If the court does not respond within 10 days after receipt of the notice, the request of the department shall be deemed granted. This section does not limit the department’s authority to revoke a child’s temporary release status and return the child to a commitment facility for any violation of the terms and conditions of the temporary release.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The court may, upon motion of the child or upon its own motion, within 60 days after imposition of a disposition of commitment, suspend the further execution of the disposition and place the child in a probation program upon such terms and conditions as the court may require. The department shall forward to the court all relevant material on the child’s progress while in custody not later than 3 working days prior to the hearing on the motion to suspend the disposition.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 39, ch. 97-238; s. 12, ch. 2000-134; s. 31, ch. 2000-135; s. 6, ch. 2005-263; s. 53, ch. 2006-120.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Subsections (3), (4) former s. 985.231(1)(d), (h).</Text></Note></Section>
