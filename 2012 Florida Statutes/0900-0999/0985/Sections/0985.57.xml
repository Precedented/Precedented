In such case the secretary shall fully advise the Governor of the facts upon which such recommendation is based.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall grant gain-time for good conduct, may grant extra good-time allowances, and may declare a forfeiture thereof.
