			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">There is created a Control Release Authority which shall be composed of the members of the Parole Commission and which shall have the same chair as the commission. The authority shall utilize such commission staff as it determines is necessary to carry out its purposes.</Text>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The authority shall implement a system for determining the number and type of inmates who must be released into the community under control release in order to maintain the state prison system between 99 and 100 percent of its total capacity as defined in s. 944.023. No inmate has a right to control release. Control release is an administrative function solely used to manage the state prison population within total capacity. An inmate may not receive an advancement of his or her control release date by an award of control release allotments for any period of time before the date the inmate becomes statutorily eligible for control release or before the subsequent date of establishment of the inmate’s advanceable control release date.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="3">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Within 120 days prior to the date the state correctional system is projected pursuant to s. 216.136 to exceed 99 percent of total capacity, the authority shall determine eligibility for and establish a control release date for an appropriate number of parole ineligible inmates committed to the department and incarcerated within the state who have been determined by the authority to be eligible for discretionary early release pursuant to this section. In establishing control release dates, it is the intent of the Legislature that the authority prioritize consideration of eligible inmates closest to their tentative release date. The authority shall rely upon commitment data on the offender information system maintained by the department to initially identify inmates who are to be reviewed for control release consideration. The authority may use a method of objective risk assessment in determining if an eligible inmate should be released. Such assessment shall be a part of the department’s management information system. However, the authority shall have sole responsibility for determining control release eligibility, establishing a control release date, and effectuating the release of a sufficient number of inmates to maintain the inmate population between 99 percent and 100 percent of total capacity. Inmates who are ineligible for control release are inmates who are parole eligible or inmates who:</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The authority shall adopt as a standard condition for all persons released pursuant to this section that such persons shall not commit a violation which constitutes a felony. The authority shall determine the appropriate terms, conditions, and lengths of supervision, if any, for persons placed on control release, except that such lengths of supervision shall be determined as provided in s. 947.24 and may not exceed the maximum period for which the person has been sentenced. If the person’s conviction was for a controlled substance violation, the conditions must include a requirement that the person submit to random substance abuse testing intermittently throughout the term of supervision, and, when warranted, a requirement that the person participate in substance abuse assessment and substance abuse treatment services upon the direction of the correctional probation officer as defined in s. 943.10(3). Effective July 1, 1994, and applicable for offenses committed on or after that date, the authority may require, as a condition of control release, that the control releasee make payment of the debt due and owing to a county or municipal detention facility under s. 951.032 for medical care, treatment, hospitalization, or transportation received by the releasee while in that detention facility. The authority, in determining whether to order such repayment and the amount of such repayment, shall consider the amount of the debt, whether there was any fault of the institution for the medical expenses incurred, the financial resources of the releasee, the present and potential future financial needs and earning ability of the releasee, and dependents, and other appropriate factors. If any inmate placed on control release supervision is also subject to probation or community control, the department shall supervise such person according to the conditions imposed by the court, and the authority shall defer to such supervision. If the court revokes the probation or community control, the authority, as the result of the revocation, may vacate the grant of control release and resulting deferred control release supervision or take other action it considers appropriate. If the term of control release supervision exceeds that of the probation or community control, then supervision shall revert to the authority’s conditions upon expiration of the probation or community control.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When the authority has reasonable grounds to believe that an offender released under this section has violated the terms and conditions of control release, such offender shall be subject to the provisions of s. 947.141 and shall be subject to forfeiture of gain-time pursuant to s. 944.28(1).</Text>

Offenders who are under control release supervision as of July 1, 1996, shall be subject to the conditions established by the authority until such offenders have been discharged from supervision. Offenders who have warrants outstanding based on violation of supervision as of July 1, 1996, or who violate the terms of their supervision subsequent to July 1, 1996, shall be subject to the provisions of s. 947.141.</Text>
