However, in no case shall bail be granted if such person has previously been convicted of a felony, the commission of which occurred prior to the commission of the subsequent felony, and such person’s civil rights have not been restored or if other felony charges are pending against the person and probable cause has been found that the person has committed the felony or felonies at the time the request for bail is made.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An order by a trial court denying bail to a person pursuant to the provisions of subsection (1) may be appealed as a matter of right to an appellate court, and such appeal shall be advanced on the calendar of the appellate court for expeditious review.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In no case may an original appearance bond be continued for the appeal. To reflect the increased risk and probability of longer time considerations, there shall be a new undertaking of a bond for the appeal.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 69-307; s. 1, ch. 76-138; s. 6, ch. 86-151; s. 1478, ch. 97-102.</History></Section>
