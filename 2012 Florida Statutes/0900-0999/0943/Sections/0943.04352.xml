		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When the court places a defendant on misdemeanor probation pursuant to ss. 948.01 and 948.15, the public or private entity providing probation services must conduct a search of the probationer’s name or other identifying information against the registration information regarding sexual predators and sexual offenders maintained by the Department of Law Enforcement under s. 943.043. The probation services provider may conduct the search using the Internet site maintained by the Department of Law Enforcement. Also, a national search must be conducted through the Dru Sjodin National Sex Offender Public Website maintained by the United States Department of Justice.</Text>
