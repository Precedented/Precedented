		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that with respect to counter-terrorism efforts and initial responses to acts of terrorism within or affecting this state, specialized efforts of emergency management which are unique to such situations are required and that these efforts intrinsically involve very close coordination of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies with the efforts of all others involved in emergency-response efforts. In order to best provide this specialized effort, the Legislature has determined that such efforts should be coordinated by and through the Department of Law Enforcement, working closely with the Division of Emergency Management and others involved in preparation against acts of terrorism in or affecting this state, and in the initial response to such acts, in accordance with the state comprehensive emergency management plan prepared pursuant to s. 252.35(2)(a).</Text>
