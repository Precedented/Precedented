In order to adequately prepare the reports, the department and the Department of Management Services shall grant access to the Correctional Medical Authority that includes access to the facilities, offenders, and any information the agencies require to complete their reports. The review shall also include an examination of promising geriatric policies, practices, and programs currently implemented in other correctional systems within the United States. The reports, with specific findings and recommendations for implementation, shall be submitted to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives on or before December 31 of each year.</Text>
