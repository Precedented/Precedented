However, priority should be given to substance-addicted inmates to help break the cycle of drug abuse, prostitution, and other self-injurious criminal behavior that causes harm to families and communities. Those inmates with a detainer are eligible if the department determines that cancellation of the detainer is likely or that the incarceration for which the detainer was issued will be of short duration. The department shall confirm the detainer with the originating authority prior to release.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 6, 12, ch. 87-298; s. 13, ch. 88-122; s. 7, ch. 92-310; s. 21, ch. 95-283; s. 7, ch. 2001-110.</History></Section>
