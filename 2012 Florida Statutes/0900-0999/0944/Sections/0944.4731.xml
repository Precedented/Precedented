If an offender has received a term of probation or community control to be served after release from incarceration, the period of probation or community control may not be substituted for addiction-recovery supervision and shall follow the term of addiction-recovery supervision. A panel of not fewer than two parole commissioners shall establish the terms and conditions of supervision, and the terms and conditions must be included in the supervision order. In setting the terms and conditions of supervision, the parole commission shall weigh heavily the program requirements, including, but not limited to, work at paid employment while participating in treatment and traveling restrictions. The commission shall also determine whether an offender violates the terms and conditions of supervision and whether a violation warrants revocation of addiction-recovery supervision pursuant to s. 947.141. The parole commission shall review the offender’s record for the purpose of establishing the terms and conditions of supervision. The parole commission may impose any special conditions it considers warranted from its review of the record. The length of supervision may not exceed the maximum penalty imposed by the court.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that offenders released from state prison into the community who meet the criteria for participating in the addiction-recovery supervision program possess the greatest potential for successful substance abuse recovery through treatment and transition assistance.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each fiscal year, and contingent upon funding, the department shall enter into contracts with multiple providers who are private organizations, including faith-based service groups, to operate substance abuse transition housing programs, including providers that:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Provide postrelease housing, programming, treatment, and other transitional services;</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Emphasize job placement and gainful employment for program participants;</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Provide a curriculum related to substance abuse treatment which uses a cognitive behavior model or 12-step model of addiction recovery;</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Provide for a length of stay of not more than 12 months; and</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Use community volunteers in operating the program to the greatest extent possible.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall allow providers to use innovative approaches to treatment and shall authorize a high level of flexibility in operating a program.
