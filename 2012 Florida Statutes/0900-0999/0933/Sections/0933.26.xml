An inspection pursuant to a warrant shall not be made by means of forcible entry, except that the judge may expressly authorize a forcible entry when facts are shown which are sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion of a violation of a state or local law or rule relating to municipal or county building, fire, safety, environmental, animal control, land use, plumbing, electrical, health, minimum housing, or zoning standards which, if such violation existed, would be an immediate threat to health or safety or when facts are shown establishing that reasonable attempts to serve a previous warrant have been unsuccessful. When prior consent has been sought and refused, notice that a warrant has been issued shall be given at least 24 hours before the warrant is executed. Immediate execution of a warrant shall be prohibited except when necessary to prevent loss of life or property.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 82-8; s. 20, ch. 89-268.</History></Section>
