Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">ARTICLE II</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">Definitions</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent" SpaceAbove="true">As used in this agreement:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(a) “State” means the United States of America, a state, territory, or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(b) “Sending state” means a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time he or she initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(c) “Receiving state” means the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information, or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">ARTICLE III</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">Request for Final Disposition</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent" SpaceAbove="true">(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he or she shall be brought to trial within 180 days after the prisoner shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer’s jurisdiction written notice of the place of his or her imprisonment and the prisoner’s request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information, or complaint; provided that, for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or the prisoner’s counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform the prisoner of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him or her and shall also inform the prisoner of his or her right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint on which the detainer is based.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations, or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed.
