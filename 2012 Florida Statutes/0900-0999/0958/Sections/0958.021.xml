It is the further purpose of this chapter to encourage citizen volunteers from the community to contribute time, skills, and maturity toward helping youthful offenders successfully reintegrate into the community and to require youthful offenders to participate in substance abuse and other types of counseling and programs at each youthful offender institution. It is the further intent of the Legislature to provide an additional sentencing alternative to be used in the discretion of the court when dealing with offenders who have demonstrated that they can no longer be handled safely as juveniles and who require more substantial limitations upon their liberty to ensure the protection of society.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 78-84; s. 18, ch. 85-288; s. 97, ch. 94-209.</History></Section>
