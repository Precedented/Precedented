		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The court shall require an evaluation by a qualified practitioner to determine the need of a probationer or community controllee for treatment. If the court determines that a need therefor is established by the evaluation process, the court shall require sexual offender treatment as a term or condition of probation or community control for any person who is required to register as a sexual predator under s. 775.21 or sexual offender under s. 943.0435, s. 944.606, or s. 944.607. Such treatment shall be required to be obtained from a qualified practitioner as defined in s. 948.001. Treatment may not be administered by a qualified practitioner who has been convicted or adjudicated delinquent of committing, or attempting, soliciting, or conspiring to commit, any offense that is listed in s. 943.0435(1)(a)1.a.(I). The court shall impose a restriction against contact with minors if sexual offender treatment is recommended. The evaluation and recommendations for treatment of the probationer or community controllee shall be provided to the court for review.</Text>
