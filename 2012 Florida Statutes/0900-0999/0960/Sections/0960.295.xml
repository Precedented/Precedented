The rights of crime victims, the state and its local subdivisions, and other aggrieved parties to seek any existing remedy for restitution, instead of or in addition to seeking a civil restitution lien order under this civil restitution lien act, are preserved.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">APPLICABILITY OF OTHER CIVIL REMEDIES; ESTOPPEL AS A LIMITATION UPON ENFORCEMENT.<EmDash />A civil restitution lien order entered under this civil restitution lien act does not bar any subsequent civil remedy or recovery, but the amount of such restitution must be set off against any subsequent independent civil recovery. Notwithstanding this civil restitution lien act, the crime victim, the state and its local subdivisions, or other aggrieved parties are not precluded from collecting costs on conviction ordered under chapter 939, relating to court costs; moneys awarded under this chapter, relating to victim assistance; moneys awarded by a restitution order under s. 775.089, relating to restitution; proceeds resulting from forfeitures ordered under chapter 895, relating to racketeering offenses and illegal debts; moneys distributed pursuant to a lien placed on the offender’s property under s. 944.512, relating to the state lien on literary and other accounts of crimes; or inmate reimbursements under chapter 946, relating to correctional work programs, except that no duplicate recovery may be made in favor of crime victims, the state and its local subdivisions, and other aggrieved parties.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 94-342; s. 33, ch. 95-184.</History></Section>
