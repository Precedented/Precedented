Such persons or their dependents may thereby suffer disabilities, incur financial hardships, or become dependent upon public assistance. The Legislature finds and determines that there is a need for government financial assistance for such victims of adult and juvenile crime. Accordingly, it is the intent of the Legislature that aid, care, and support be provided by the state, as a matter of moral responsibility, for such victims of adult and juvenile crime. It is the express intent of the Legislature that all state departments and agencies cooperate with the Department of Legal Affairs in carrying out the provisions of this chapter.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-452; s. 2, ch. 80-146; s. 1, ch. 91-23; s. 19, ch. 92-287.</History></Section>
