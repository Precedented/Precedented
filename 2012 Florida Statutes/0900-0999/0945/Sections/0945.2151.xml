The department shall, in adherence with its agreement with the Social Security Administration and in a timely manner, submit sufficient and necessary information to verify that the reported inmate’s social security number is accurate and properly belongs to the inmate. If the Social Security Administration is unable to verify a reported social security number for an inmate, the department shall prohibit canteen purchases by the inmate if the department concludes that the inmate was deceptive in reporting the social security number. The prohibition against purchasing canteen items will remain in effect until a verified social security number is obtained.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 49, ch. 96-312.</History></Section>
