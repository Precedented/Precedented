In order to provide these services, the state’s dependency and delinquency systems must have the ability to identify and provide appropriate intervention and treatment for children with personal or family-related substance abuse problems. It is therefore the purpose of the Legislature to provide authority for the state to contract with community substance abuse treatment providers for the development and operation of specialized support and overlay services for the dependency and delinquency systems, which will be fully implemented and utilized as resources permit.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">JUVENILE JUSTICE AND DELINQUENCY PREVENTION.<EmDash />It is the policy of the state with respect to juvenile justice and delinquency prevention to first protect the public from acts of delinquency.

The state further recognizes that the ability of parents, custodians, and guardians to fulfill those responsibilities can be greatly impaired by economic, social, behavioral, emotional, and related problems. It is therefore the policy of the Legislature that it is the state’s responsibility to ensure that factors impeding the ability of caretakers to fulfill their responsibilities are identified through the delinquency intake process and that appropriate recommendations to address those problems are considered in any judicial or nonjudicial proceeding.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 88, ch. 97-238.</History></Section>
