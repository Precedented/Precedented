Such a reversionary ownership interest of the state in any and all such after-acquired facilities by the corporation is in furtherance of the goals established in s. 946.502(4), and such a present ownership interest by the state is a continuing and insurable state interest.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (1), the ownership of any permanent enhancements made to facilities or work programs is vested in the department.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 83-209; ss. 4, 8, ch. 87-286; s. 8, ch. 94-265; s. 4, ch. 97-227.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 946.035.</Text></Note></Section>
