The department is authorized to adopt rules governing work and supervision of inmates used in public works projects, which rules shall include, but shall not be limited to, the proper screening and supervision of such inmates. Inmates may be used for these purposes without being accompanied by a correctional officer, provided the political subdivision, municipality, or agency of the state or the nonprofit corporation provides proper supervision pursuant to the rules of the Department of Corrections.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The budget of the department may be reimbursed from the budget of any state agency or state institution for the services of inmates and personnel of the department in such amounts as may be determined by agreement between the department and the head of such agency or institution.
