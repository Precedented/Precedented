The rules shall provide for an informal, nonbinding mediation process, and for binding arbitration when mediation fails to resolve a dispute, and shall provide minimum qualifications for arbitrators substantially similar to other arbitration programs under the Florida Insurance Code. The rules shall specify the types of disputes that are subject to mediation or arbitration, and shall provide that disputes over increases in monthly maintenance fees are not subject to mediation or arbitration. Arbitration is available only if all parties agree in advance to be bound by the result.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 93-22; s. 1696, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
