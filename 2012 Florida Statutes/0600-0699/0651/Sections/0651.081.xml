			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Residents living in a facility holding a valid certificate of authority under this chapter have the right of self-organization, the right to be represented by an individual of their own choosing, and the right to engage in concerted activities for the purpose of keeping informed on the operation of the facility that is caring for them or for the purpose of other mutual aid or protection.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A residents’ council created for the purpose of representing residents on matters set forth in s. 651.085 may be established through an election in which the residents, as defined in s. 651.011, vote by ballot, physically or by proxy. If the election is to be held during a meeting, a notice of the organizational meeting must be provided to all residents of the community at least 10 business days before the meeting. Notice may be given through internal mailboxes, communitywide newsletters, bulletin boards, in-house television stations, and other similar means of communication. An election creating a residents’ council is valid if at least 40 percent of the total resident population participates in the election and a majority of the participants vote affirmatively for the council. The initial residents’ council created under this section is valid for at least 12 months. A residents’ organization formalized by bylaws and elected officials must be recognized as the residents’ council under this section and s. 651.085. Within 30 days after the election of a newly elected president or chair of the residents’ council, the provider shall give the president or chair a copy of this chapter and rules adopted thereunder, or direct him or her to the appropriate public website to obtain this information. Only one residents’ council may represent residents before the governing body of the provider as described in s. 651.085(2).</Text>
