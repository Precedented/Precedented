Such refund must be paid within 60 days after giving notice of intention to cancel. For a resident who has occupied his or her unit and who has received a transferable membership or ownership right in the facility, the foregoing refund provisions do not apply but are deemed satisfied by the acquisition or receipt of a transferable membership or an ownership right in the facility. The provider may not charge any fee for the transfer of membership or sale of an ownership right.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="h"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">State the terms under which a contract is canceled by the death of the resident.
