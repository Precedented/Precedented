<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0636.022" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Restrictions upon expulsion or refusal to issue or renew contract.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A prepaid limited health service organization may not expel or refuse to renew the coverage of or refuse to enroll any individual member of a subscriber group on the basis of the race, color, creed, handicap, marital status, sex, or national origin of the subscriber or individual. A prepaid limited health service organization may not expel or refuse to renew the coverage of any individual member of a subscriber group on the basis of the age or health status of the subscriber or individual. For group solicitations, a prepaid limited health service organization may preunderwrite to determine group acceptability. However, once a contract is issued, a prepaid limited health service organization must provide coverage to all existing enrollees and their dependents, and newly employed enrollees and their dependents who have enrolled within 30 days of eligibility or membership. Late enrollees who apply during other than an open enrollment period may be subject to evidence of insurability requirements of the prepaid limited health service organization. Nothing in this section prohibits a prepaid limited health service organization from requiring that, as a condition of continued eligibility for membership, dependents of a subscriber upon reaching a specified age convert to a converted contract. Coverage must continue to be provided to handicapped children who are incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of mental or physical handicap, and substantially dependent upon the enrollee for support and maintenance.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 17, ch. 93-148.</History></Section>
