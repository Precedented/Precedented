Damages can include both the actual loss caused by misappropriation and the unjust enrichment caused by misappropriation that is not taken into account in computing actual loss. In lieu of damages measured by any other methods, the damages caused by misappropriation may be measured by imposition of liability for a reasonable royalty for a misappropriator’s unauthorized disclosure or use of a trade secret.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If willful and malicious misappropriation exists, the court may award exemplary damages in an amount not exceeding twice any award made under subsection (1).</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 88-254.</History></Section>
