The order shall contain notice of opportunity for a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57, where the financial institution-affiliated party may request a postsuspension hearing to show that continued service to or participation in the affairs of the state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation does not pose a threat to the interests of the state financial institution’s depositors, members, or stockholders, or threaten to impair public confidence in the state financial institution. In accordance with applicable commission rules, the office shall notify the financial institution-affiliated party whether the order suspending or prohibiting the financial institution-affiliated party from participation in the affairs of a state financial institution, subsidiary, or service corporation will be rescinded or otherwise modified. The emergency order will remain in effect, unless otherwise modified by the office, until the criminal charge is disposed of. The acquittal of the financial institution-affiliated party charged, or the final, unappealed dismissal of all charges against such person, will dissolve the emergency order, but will not prohibit the office from instituting proceedings under subsection (1). If the financial institution-affiliated party charged is convicted or pleads guilty or nolo contendere, whether or not an adjudication of guilt is entered by the court, the emergency order becomes final.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any financial institution-affiliated party removed from office pursuant to this section is not eligible for reelection to such position or to any official position in any financial institution in this state except with the written consent of the office.
