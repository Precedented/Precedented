		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any certified firefighter who has not been active as a firefighter, or as a volunteer firefighter with an organized fire department, for a period of 3 years shall be required to retake the practical portion of the minimum standards state examination specified in rule 69A-37.056(6)(b), Florida Administrative Code, in order to maintain her or his certification as a firefighter; however, this requirement does not apply to state-certified firefighters who are certified and employed as full-time firesafety inspectors or firesafety instructors, regardless of the firefighter’s employment status. The 3-year period begins on the date the certificate of compliance is issued or upon termination of service with an organized fire department.</Text>
