			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Certificates shall expire every 2 years at midnight on June 30. Effective with the June 30, 1998, renewal, all certificates must be renewed every 2 years. The failure to renew a certificate during June shall cause the certificate to become inoperative, and it is unlawful thereafter for any person to engage, offer to engage, or hold herself or himself out as engaging in contracting under the certificate unless the certificate is restored or reissued. A certificate which is inoperative because of failure to renew shall be restored on payment of the proper renewal fee if the application for restoration is made within 90 days after June 30. If the application for restoration is not made within the 90-day period, the fee for restoration shall be equal to the original application fee, and, in addition, the State Fire Marshal shall require examination or reexamination of the applicant.</Text>
