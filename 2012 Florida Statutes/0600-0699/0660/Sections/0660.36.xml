Instead of acting personally, any trust company or trust department may employ any other trust company or trust department to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary, provided the trust company or trust department serving as such agent shall observe the same standard of care as is required of the principal fiduciary trust company or trust department with respect to each fiduciary account or other relationship affected by such agency. The establishment of such agency relationship shall neither diminish nor increase the standard by which the performance of the principal fiduciary trust company or trust department as a fiduciary is governed. In any suit or other proceeding involving an evaluation of fiduciary performance, such agent’s performance shall be deemed that of the principal fiduciary trust company or trust department.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 76-37; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 134, 151, 152, ch. 80-260; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; s. 1, ch. 91-307; s. 1, ch. 92-303.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 660.011.</Text></Note></Section>
