The report of such audit shall include a list of the investments comprising the common trust fund at the time of the audit, which shall show the valuation placed on each item on such list by the board of directors or the trust investment committee of the trust company or trust department as of the date of the audit; a statement of purchases, sales, and any other investment changes and of income and disbursements since the last audit; and appropriate comments as to any investment in default as to payment of principal or interest. The reasonable expenses of any such audit made by independent public accountants may be charged to the common trust fund.
