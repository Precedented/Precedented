An acceptance of assurance may be conditioned on a commitment to reimburse agreement purchasers or to take other appropriate corrective action. An assurance is not evidence of a prior violation of this part. However, unless an assurance has been rescinded by agreement of the parties or voided by a court for good cause, the subsequent failure to comply with the terms of an assurance is prima facie evidence of a violation of this part. No such assurance shall act as a limitation upon any action or remedy available to a person aggrieved by a violation of this part.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 29, 33, ch. 82-234; s. 68, ch. 91-106; s. 20, ch. 93-195; s. 465, ch. 97-102; s. 1442, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
