If a security interest in a security is perfected at the date this act takes effect but the action by which the security interest was perfected would not suffice to perfect a security interest under this act, the security interest remains perfected for a period of 4 months after the effective date and continues perfected thereafter if appropriate action to perfect under this act is taken within that period. If a security interest is perfected at the date this act takes effect and the security interest can be perfected by filing under this act, a financing statement signed by the secured party instead of the debtor may be filed within that period to continue perfection or thereafter to perfect.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 24, ch. 98-11.</History></Section>
