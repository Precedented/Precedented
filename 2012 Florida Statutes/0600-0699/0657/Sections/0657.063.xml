			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the office finds that any credit union is insolvent or imminently insolvent; is transacting its business in an unsound, unsafe, or unauthorized manner such that it is threatened with imminent insolvency, and liquidation is in the best interest of the members; or is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized, the office may, in its discretion, order the credit union placed in involuntary liquidation and designate and appoint a liquidator to take charge of the assets and affairs of the credit union. The order shall set forth the specific findings and reasons for the action taken. The commission may define by rule criteria for determining if a credit union is undercapitalized or adequately capitalized. In defining such criteria, the commission shall consider the definitions contained in s. 216, the Federal Credit Union Act, codified at 12 U.S.C. s. 1790d.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon appointment and in accordance with the directions of the office, the liquidator shall take possession and charge of all of the assets, books, and records of the credit union and shall take charge of the affairs, business, and operations of the credit union and shall have all of the powers of the board of directors, credit committee, credit manager, and supervisory committee of the credit union. The liquidator shall continue the business operation of the credit union for a period not to exceed 180 days, subject to the direction of the office. The liquidator shall have full authority to make loans and investments and to permit deposits to or withdrawals from accounts by members, except that during the period of such operation by the liquidator, no withdrawal from any account or accounts which are not fully insured shall be permitted. Except when prohibited by federal or state law, the liquidator may, without penalty or liability, prepay any deposit accounts; terminate any contracts or agreements with employees, independent contractors, or consultants; terminate any contract or agreement with any person to provide goods, products, or services if the performance of such contract would adversely affect the safety or soundness of the credit union; and terminate or assign any lease for property. The liquidator shall proceed with a liquidation of assets by sale or transfer of assets and conversion of assets into cash or liquid investments in preparation for distribution to members on account of shares and deposits. The liquidator shall have specific authority to sell loan assets. The liquidator may enter into agreements for the sale or transfer of loans and other assets with the assumption of outstanding share and deposit accounts, which assumption constitutes full and complete distribution to members on account of shares and deposits.</Text>
