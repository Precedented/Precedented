If a majority of the managers or managing members who have no such relationship or interest in the transaction vote to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction, a quorum is present for the purpose of taking action under this section. The presence of, or a vote cast by, a manager or managing member with such relationship or interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action taken under paragraph (1)(a) if the transaction is otherwise authorized, approved, or ratified as provided in that subsection, but such presence or vote of those managers or managing members may be counted for purposes of determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this chapter.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For purposes of paragraph (1)(b) only, a conflict of interest transaction is authorized, approved, or ratified if it receives the vote of a majority-in-interest of the members entitled to be counted under this subsection. Membership interests owned by or voted under the control of a manager or managing member who has a relationship or interest in the transaction described in subsection (1) may not be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction under paragraph (1)(b). The vote of those membership interests, however, is counted in determining whether the transaction is approved under other sections of this act. A majority-in-interest of the members, whether or not present, that are entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 99-315; s. 12, ch. 2002-272.</History></Section>
