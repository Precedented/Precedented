			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Unless otherwise provided in the articles of organization or operating agreement, an assignee of a limited liability company interest may become a member only if all members other than the member assigning the interest consent.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An assignee who has become a member has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of the assigning member under the articles of organization, the operating agreement, and this chapter. An assignee who becomes a member also is liable for the obligations of the assignee’s assignor to make and return contributions as provided in s. 608.4211 and wrongful distributions as provided in s. 608.428. However, the assignee is not obligated for liabilities which are unknown to the assignee at the time the assignee became a member and which could not be ascertained from the articles of organization or the operating agreement.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If an assignee of a limited liability company interest becomes a member, the assignor is not released from liability to the limited liability company under s. 608.4211, s. 608.4228, or s. 608.426.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a member or a member’s assignee, the court may enter a charging order against the limited liability company interest of the judgment debtor or assignee rights for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment plus interest.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor’s limited liability company interest or assignee rights. Under a charging order, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of a limited liability company interest to receive any distribution or distributions to which the judgment debtor would otherwise have been entitled from the limited liability company, to the extent of the judgment, including interest.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This chapter does not deprive any member or member’s assignee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the member’s limited liability company interest or the assignee’s rights to distributions from the limited liability company.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="5">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except as provided in subsections (6) and (7), a charging order is the sole and exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or member’s assignee may satisfy a judgment from the judgment debtor’s interest in a limited liability company or rights to distributions from the limited liability company.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="6">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In the case of a limited liability company having only one member, if a judgment creditor of a member or member’s assignee establishes to the satisfaction of a court of competent jurisdiction that distributions under a charging order will not satisfy the judgment within a reasonable time, a charging order is not the sole and exclusive remedy by which the judgment creditor may satisfy the judgment against a judgment debtor who is the sole member of a limited liability company or the assignee of the sole member, and upon such showing, the court may order the sale of that interest in the limited liability company pursuant to a foreclosure sale. A judgment creditor may make a showing to the court that distributions under a charging order will not satisfy the judgment within a reasonable time at any time after the entry of the judgment and may do so at the same time that the judgment creditor applies for the entry of a charging order.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In the case of a limited liability company having only one member, if the court orders foreclosure sale of a judgment debtor’s interest in the limited liability company or of a charging order lien against the sole member of the limited liability company pursuant to subsection (6):</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The purchaser at the court-ordered foreclosure sale obtains the member’s entire limited liability company interest, not merely the rights of an assignee;</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The purchaser at the sale becomes the member of the limited liability company; and</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In the case of a limited liability company having more than one member, the remedy of foreclosure on a judgment debtor’s interest in such limited liability company or against rights to distribution from such limited liability company is not available to a judgment creditor attempting to satisfy the judgment and may not be ordered by a court.</Text>
