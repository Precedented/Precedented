Subject to the limitations hereinafter set forth, the construction shall be deemed unreasonable in any of the following cases:</Text><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The language tending to negate or limit the warranty is not conspicuous, written, and contained in a provision separate and apart from any language relevant to the creation of the warranty, in words which would clearly and specifically apprise the buyer that the seller assumes no risk, liability, or responsibility for the authenticity of the authorship of a work of art. Words of general disclaimer like “all warranties, express or implied, are excluded” are not sufficient to negate or limit express warranty of authenticity of the authorship of a work of art created under s. 686.504 or otherwise.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The work of art is proved to be a counterfeit, and this was not clearly indicated in the description of the work.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The work of art is unqualifiedly stated to be the work of a named author or authorship, or date or period or limited edition, and it is proved that, as of the date of sale or exchange, the statement was false, mistaken, or erroneous.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 86-118.</History></Section>
