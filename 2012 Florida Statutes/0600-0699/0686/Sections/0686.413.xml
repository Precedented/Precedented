However, the failure to deliver any such equipment is not considered a violation of this section if such failure is due to a prudent and reasonable restriction on the extension of credit by the franchisor to the dealer, an act of God, a work stoppage or delay due to a strike or labor difficulty, a bona fide shortage of materials, a freight embargo, or another cause over which the manufacturer, distributor, or wholesaler, or any agent thereof, has no control whatsoever.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">To coerce, compel, or attempt to coerce or compel any dealer to enter into any agreement, whether written or oral, supplementary to an existing franchise with such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof; or to do any other act prejudicial to such dealer by threatening to cancel any franchise or contractual agreement existing between such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division and such dealer. However, notice in good faith to any dealer of such dealer’s violation or breach of any terms or provisions of such franchise or contractual agreement does not constitute a violation of this section if such notice is in writing and is mailed by registered or certified mail to such dealer at her or his current business address and such notice contains the specific facts as to the dealer’s violation or breach of such franchise or contractual agreement.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">To terminate the franchise or selling agreement of any dealer without due cause, as defined in subparagraph 2. The termination of a franchise or selling agreement, without due cause, constitutes an unfair termination, regardless of the specified time period of such franchise or selling agreement. Except when the ground for such termination falls within sub-subparagraph 2.c., such manufacturer, factory branch or division, distributor, distributor branch or division, wholesaler, or wholesale branch or division, or officer, agent, or other representative thereof, shall notify a dealer in writing of the termination of the franchise or selling agreement of such dealer at least 180 days before the effective date of the termination, stating the specific ground for such termination. In no event shall the contractual term of any such franchise or selling agreement expire, without the written consent of the dealer involved, prior to the expiration of at least 180 days following such written notice. During the 180-day period, either party may, in appropriate circumstances, petition a court of competent jurisdiction to modify such 180-day stay or to extend it pending a final determination of such proceeding on the merits.

After such notice, the manufacturer or other entity issuing the notice shall make good faith efforts to work with the dealer to gain the desired market share, including, without limitation, reasonably making available to the dealer an adequate inventory of new equipment and parts and competitive marketing programs. The manufacturer or other entity, at the end of the 1-year notice period, may terminate or elect not to renew the agreement only upon further written notice specifying the reasons for determining that the dealer failed to meet reasonable marketing criteria or market penetration. Such written notice must specify that termination is effective 90 days from the date of the notice.
