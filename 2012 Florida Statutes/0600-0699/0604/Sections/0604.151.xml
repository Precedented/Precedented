Therefore, it is necessary in the interest of the public welfare to regulate agricultural products dealers in this state. However, restrictions shall be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public from significant and discernible harm or damage and not in a manner which will unreasonably affect the competitive market.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 3, 14, ch. 79-238; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 9, 10, ch. 90-161; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
