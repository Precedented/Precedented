If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 2001-198.</History></Section>
