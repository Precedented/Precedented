		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Section 5, ch. 2012-59, added subsections (8) and (9), effective July 1, 2013, to read:</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(8) The following rules apply to collateral to which a security interest attaches within 4 months after the debtor changes its location to another jurisdiction:</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(a) A financing statement filed before the change of the debtor’s location pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in s. 679.3011(1) or s. 679.3051(3) is effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the debtor had not changed its location.</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(b) If a security interest that is perfected by a financing statement that is effective under paragraph (a) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in s. 679.3011(1) or s. 679.3051(3) or the expiration of the 4-month period, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(9) If a financing statement naming an original debtor is filed pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in s. 679.3011(1) or s. 679.3051(3) and the new debtor is located in another jurisdiction, the following rules apply:</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(a) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights before or within 4 months after the new debtor becomes bound under s. 679.2031(4), if the financing statement would have been effective to perfect a security interest in the collateral if the collateral had been acquired by the original debtor.</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(b) A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement and that becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the expiration of the 4-month period or the time the financing statement would have become ineffective under the law of the jurisdiction designated in s. 679.3011(1) or s. 679.3051(3) remains perfected thereafter. A security interest that is perfected by the financing statement but that does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier time or event becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.</Text>
