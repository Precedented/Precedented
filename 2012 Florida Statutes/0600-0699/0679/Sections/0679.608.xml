If authorized in an authenticated record, the interpleading secured party is entitled to be paid from the remaining proceeds the actual costs of the filing fee and an attorney’s fee in the amount of $250 incurred in connection with filing the interpleader action and obtaining an order approving the interpleader of funds. The debtor in a consumer transaction may not be assessed for the attorney’s fees and costs incurred in the interpleader action by the holders of subordinate security interests or other liens based upon disputes among said holders, and a debtor in a transaction other than a consumer transaction may only recover such fees and costs to the extent provided for in an authenticated record. If authorized in an authenticated record, the court in the interpleader action may award reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the prevailing party in a dispute between the debtor and a holder of a security interest or lien which claims an interest in the remaining interplead proceeds, but only if the debtor challenges the validity, priority, or extent of said security interest or lien. Except as provided in this subsection, a debtor may not be assessed attorney’s fees and costs incurred by any party in an interpleader action commenced under this section.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 2001-198.</History></Section>
