			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The solvency requirements of ss. 1855 and 1856 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and 42 C.F.R. s. 422.350, subpart H, apply to a health maintenance organization that is a provider-sponsored organization rather than the solvency requirements of this part. However, if the provider-sponsored organization does not meet the solvency requirements of this part, the organization is limited to the issuance of Medicare+Choice plans to eligible individuals. For the purposes of this section, the terms “Medicare+Choice plans,” “provider-sponsored organizations,” and “solvency requirements” have the same meaning as defined in the federal act and federal rules and regulations.</Text>
