			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A health maintenance contract under which coverage is purchased in whole or in part with any state or federal funds through an exchange created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, may not provide coverage for an abortion as defined in s. 390.011(1), except if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest, or in the case where a woman suffers from a physical disorder, physical injury, or physical illness, including a life-endangering physical condition caused by or arising from the pregnancy itself, which would, as certified by a physician, place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed. Coverage is deemed to be purchased with state or federal funds if any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied toward the health maintenance contract.</Text>
