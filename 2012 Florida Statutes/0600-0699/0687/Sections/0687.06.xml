This chapter shall not be construed so as to prohibit mortgagees from contracting for or collecting premiums for insurance actually issued on the property mortgaged, with the usual loss payable or mortgage clause attached thereto; provided further, that it shall not be necessary for the court to adjudge an attorney’s fee, provided in any note or other instrument of writing, to be reasonable and just, when such fee does not exceed 10 percent of the principal sum named in said note, or other instrument in writing.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 5960, 1909; s. 1, ch. 6870, 1915; RGS 4854; CGL 6941; s. 26, ch. 73-334.</History></Section>
