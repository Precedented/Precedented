However, only one such delinquency charge may be collected on any installment, regardless of the period during which it remains in default. A delinquency charge imposed pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed interest or a finance charge made incident to or as a condition to the grant of the loan or other extension of credit and shall not be included in determining the limit on charges, as provided by this section, which may be made in connection with the loan or other extension of credit as provided by law of this state.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purpose of this chapter, the rate of interest on any loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance to enforce the collection of a debt, or other obligation to pay interest shall be determined and computed upon the assumption that the debt will be paid according to the agreed terms, whether or not said loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance to enforce collection of a debt, or other obligation is paid or collected by court action prior to its term, and any payment or property charged, reserved, or taken as an advance or forbearance, which is in the nature of, and taken into account in the calculation of, interest shall be valued as of the date received and shall be spread over the stated term of the loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance to enforce collection of a debt, or other obligation for the purpose of determining the rate of interest. The spreading of any such advance or forbearance for the purpose of computing the rate of interest shall be calculated by first computing the advance or forbearance as a percentage of the total stated amount of such loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance to enforce collection of a debt, or other obligation. This percentage shall then be divided by the number of years, and fractions thereof, of the loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance to enforce collection of a debt, or other obligation according to its stated maturity date, without regard to early maturity in the event of default. The resulting annual percentage rate shall then be added to the stated annual percentage rate of interest to produce the effective rate of interest for purposes of this chapter. Moreover, for the purposes of this chapter, a loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation shall be deemed to exceed $500,000 in amount or value if:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The outstanding principal indebtedness of such loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation initially exceeds $500,000; or</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The aggregate principal indebtedness of such loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation may reasonably be expected to exceed $500,000 during the term thereof, notwithstanding the fact that less than that amount in the aggregate is initially or at any time thereafter advanced in one transaction or a series of related transactions; or</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Such loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation exceeds $500,000 at any time, notwithstanding the fact that such indebtedness is or is not subsequently reduced to less than $500,000 and thereafter additional amounts are advanced in one transaction or a series of related transactions which in the aggregate do not exceed $500,000.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If, as provided in subsection (3), a loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation exceeds $500,000, then, for the purposes of this chapter, interest on that loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation shall not include the value of property charged, reserved, or taken as an advance or forbearance, the value of which substantially depends on the success of the venture in which are used the proceeds of that loan, advance of money, line of credit, forbearance, or other obligation. Stock options and interests in profits, receipts, or residual values are examples of the type of property the value of which would be excluded from calculation of interest under the preceding sentence.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As amended by chapter 79-592, Laws of Florida, chapter 79-274, Laws of Florida, which amended subsection (1):</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Shall apply only to loans, advances of credit, or lines of credit made on or subsequent to July 1, 1979, and to loans, advances of credit, or lines of credit made prior to that date if the lender has the legal right to require full payment or to adjust or modify the interest rate, by renewal, assumption, reaffirmation, contract, or otherwise; and</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Shall not be construed as diminishing the force and effect of any laws applying to loans, advances of credit, or lines of credit, other than to those mentioned in paragraph (a), completed prior to July 1, 1979.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 4022, 1891; GS 3105; s. 2, ch. 5960, 1909; RGS 4851; CGL 6938; s. 2, ch. 29705, 1955; s. 1, ch. 70-331; s. 2, ch. 73-298; s. 1, ch. 74-232; ss. 1, 2, ch. 76-124; s. 1, ch. 77-374; s. 1, ch. 78-211; ss. 13, 15, ch. 79-274; s. 258, ch. 79-400; s. 1, ch. 79-592; s. 2, ch. 80-310; s. 34, ch. 93-268; s. 4, ch. 95-234.</History></Section>
