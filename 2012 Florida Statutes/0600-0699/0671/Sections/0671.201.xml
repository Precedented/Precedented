Except as otherwise provided in s. 672.505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under chapter 672 or chapter 680 to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a security interest, but a seller or lessor may also acquire a security interest by complying with chapter 679. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods, notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under s. 672.401, is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest.
