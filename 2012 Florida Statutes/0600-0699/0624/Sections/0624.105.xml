		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any regulated company as defined in s. 350.111, any electric utility as defined in s. 366.02(2), any utility as defined in s. 367.021(12) or s. 367.022(2) and (7), and any provider of communications services as defined in s. 202.11(1) may charge for and include an optional waiver of liability provision in their customer contracts under which the entity agrees to waive all or a portion of the customer’s liability for service from the entity for a defined period in the event of the customer’s call to active military service, death, disability, involuntary unemployment, qualification for family leave, or similar qualifying event or condition. Such provisions may not be effective in the customer’s contract with the entity unless affirmatively elected by the customer. No such provision shall constitute insurance so long as the provision is a contract between the entity and its customer.</Text>
