Accordingly, title insurers may petition for a rate deviation as provided by s. 627.783, Florida Statutes, for the uniform commercial code insurance product. In determining whether to approve such petition for a rate deviation for the uniform commercial code insurance product, the office shall be guided by standards for national rates for the product currently being offered in other states.”</Text></Note></Section>
