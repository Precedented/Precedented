The office shall issue to the applicant insurer a proper certificate of authority if it finds that the insurer has met the requirements of this code, exclusive of the requirements relative to the filing and approval of an insurer’s policy forms, riders, endorsements, applications, and rates. If it does not so find, the office shall issue its order refusing the certificate. The certificate, if issued, shall specify the kind or kinds and line or lines of insurance the insurer is authorized to transact in this state. The issuance of a certificate of authority does not signify that an insurer has met the requirements of this code relative to the filing and approval of an insurer’s policy forms, riders, endorsements, applications, and rates which may be required prior to an insurer actually writing any premiums.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 58, ch. 59-205; s. 1, ch. 65-242; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 21, ch. 78-95; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 50, 64, 809(1st), ch. 82-243; s. 31, ch. 89-360; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 794, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
