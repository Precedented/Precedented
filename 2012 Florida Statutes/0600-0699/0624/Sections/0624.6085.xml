Initiation of such coverage is triggered by the mortgagor’s failure to maintain insurance coverage as required by the mortgage or other lending document. Collateral protection insurance is not residential coverage.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 10, ch. 99-204.</History></Section>
