The insurer that files for the deviations provided in this subsection shall file the qualifications for the plans, schedules of rating factors, and the maximum deviation factors which shall be subject to the approval of the office pursuant to s. 627.091. The actual deviation which shall be used for each insured that qualifies under this subsection may not exceed the maximum filed deviation under that plan and shall be based on the merits of each insured’s individual risk as determined by using schedules of rating factors which shall be applied uniformly. Insurers shall maintain statistical data in accordance with the schedule of rating factors. Such data shall be available to support the continued use of such varying deviations.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In considering an application for the deviation, the office shall give consideration to the applicable principles for ratemaking as set forth in ss. 627.062 and 627.072 and the financial condition of the insurer. In evaluating the financial condition of the insurer, the office may consider: (1) the insurer’s audited financial statements and whether the statements provide unqualified opinions or contain significant qualifications or “subject to” provisions; (2) any independent or other actuarial certification of loss reserves; (3) whether workers’ compensation and employer’s liability reserves are above the midpoint or best estimate of the actuary’s reserve range estimate; (4) the adequacy of the proposed rate; (5) historical experience demonstrating the profitability of the insurer; (6) the existence of excess or other reinsurance that contains a sufficiently low attachment point and maximums that provide adequate protection to the insurer; and (7) other factors considered relevant to the financial condition of the insurer by the office. The office shall approve the deviation if it finds it to be justified, it would not endanger the financial condition of the insurer, and it would not constitute predatory pricing. The office shall disapprove the deviation if it finds that the resulting premiums would be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, would endanger the financial condition of the insurer, or would result in predatory pricing. The insurer may not use a deviation unless the deviation is specifically approved by the office. An insurer may apply the premiums approved pursuant to s. 627.091 or its uniform deviation approved pursuant to this section to a particular insured according to underwriting guidelines filed with and approved by the office, such approval to be based on ss. 627.062 and 627.072.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each deviation permitted to be filed shall be effective for a period of 1 year unless terminated, extended, or modified with the approval of the office. If at any time after a deviation has been approved the office finds that the deviation no longer meets the requirements of this code, it shall notify the insurer in what respects it finds that the deviation fails to meet such requirements and specify when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the deviation shall be deemed no longer effective. The notice shall not affect any insurance contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth in the notice.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For purposes of this section, the office, when considering the experience of any insurer, shall consider the experience of any predecessor insurer when the business and the liabilities of the predecessor insurer were assumed by the insurer pursuant to an order of the office which approves the assumption of the business and the liabilities.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The office shall submit an annual report to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by January 1 of each year which evaluates competition in the workers’ compensation insurance market in this state. The report must contain an analysis of the availability and affordability of workers’ compensation coverage and whether the current market structure, conduct, and performance are conducive to competition, based upon economic analysis and tests. The purpose of this report is to aid the Legislature in determining whether changes to the workers’ compensation rating laws are warranted. The report must also document that the office has complied with the provisions of s. 627.096 which require the office to investigate and study all workers’ compensation insurers in the state and to study the data, statistics, schedules, or other information as it finds necessary to assist in its review of workers’ compensation rate filings.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 431, ch. 59-205; s. 12, ch. 67-9; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 21, ch. 78-95; s. 103, ch. 79-40; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 357, 806, ch. 82-243; s. 49, ch. 82-386; ss. 6, 9, 10, ch. 87-124; s. 17, ch. 90-249; s. 7, ch. 90-366; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 1, ch. 96-405; s. 96, ch. 2002-1; s. 1087, ch. 2003-261; s. 3, ch. 2004-82.</History></Section>
