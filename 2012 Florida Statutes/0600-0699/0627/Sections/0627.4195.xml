A report, in lieu of records, may be submitted by a psychotherapist in support of a claim. Such report must include clear statements summarizing the insured’s presenting symptoms, what transpired in any provided therapy, what progress, if any, was made by the insured and results obtained. However, the insurer may require the records upon which the report is based, if the report does not contain sufficient information for properly processing the claim. A psychotherapist submitting records in support of a claim may obscure portions to conceal the names, identities, or identifying information of people other than the insured if this information is unnecessary to utilization review, quality management, discharge planning, case management, or claims processing conducted by the insurer. An insurer may provide aggregate data which does not disclose subscriber identities or identities of other persons to entities such as payors, sponsors, researchers and accreditation bodies.
