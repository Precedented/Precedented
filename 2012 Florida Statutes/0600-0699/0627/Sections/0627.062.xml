				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Insurers or rating organizations shall establish and use rates, rating schedules, or rating manuals that allow the insurer a reasonable rate of return on the classes of insurance written in this state. A copy of rates, rating schedules, rating manuals, premium credits or discount schedules, and surcharge schedules, and changes thereto, must be filed with the office under one of the following procedures:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the filing is made at least 90 days before the proposed effective date and is not implemented during the office’s review of the filing and any proceeding and judicial review, such filing is considered a “file and use” filing. In such case, the office shall finalize its review by issuance of a notice of intent to approve or a notice of intent to disapprove within 90 days after receipt of the filing. The notice of intent to approve and the notice of intent to disapprove constitute agency action for purposes of the Administrative Procedure Act. Requests for supporting information, requests for mathematical or mechanical corrections, or notification to the insurer by the office of its preliminary findings does not toll the 90-day period during any such proceedings and subsequent judicial review. The rate shall be deemed approved if the office does not issue a notice of intent to approve or a notice of intent to disapprove within 90 days after receipt of the filing.</Text>

					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the filing is not made in accordance with subparagraph 1., such filing must be made as soon as practicable, but within 30 days after the effective date, and is considered a “use and file” filing. An insurer making a “use and file” filing is potentially subject to an order by the office to return to policyholders those portions of rates found to be excessive, as provided in paragraph (h).</Text>

					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For all property insurance filings made or submitted after January 25, 2007, but before May 1, 2012, an insurer seeking a rate that is greater than the rate most recently approved by the office shall make a “file and use” filing.

The commission may adopt rules using reasonable techniques of actuarial science and economics to specify the manner in which insurers calculate investment income attributable to classes of insurance written in this state and the manner in which investment income is used to calculate insurance rates. Such manner must contemplate allowances for an underwriting profit factor and full consideration of investment income which produce a reasonable rate of return; however, investment income from invested surplus may not be considered.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In reviewing a rate filing, the office may require the insurer to provide, at the insurer’s expense, all information necessary to evaluate the condition of the company and the reasonableness of the filing according to the criteria enumerated in this section.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="g">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The office may at any time review a rate, rating schedule, rating manual, or rate change; the pertinent records of the insurer; and market conditions. If the office finds on a preliminary basis that a rate may be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, the office shall initiate proceedings to disapprove the rate and shall so notify the insurer. However, the office may not disapprove as excessive any rate for which it has given final approval or which has been deemed approved for 1 year after the effective date of the filing unless the office finds that a material misrepresentation or material error was made by the insurer or was contained in the filing. Upon being notified, the insurer or rating organization shall, within 60 days, file with the office all information that, in the belief of the insurer or organization, proves the reasonableness, adequacy, and fairness of the rate or rate change. The office shall issue a notice of intent to approve or a notice of intent to disapprove pursuant to paragraph (a) within 90 days after receipt of the insurer’s initial response. In such instances and in any administrative proceeding relating to the legality of the rate, the insurer or rating organization shall carry the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to show that the rate is not excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory. After the office notifies an insurer that a rate may be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, unless the office withdraws the notification, the insurer may not alter the rate except to conform to the office’s notice until the earlier of 120 days after the date the notification was provided or 180 days after the date of implementing the rate. The office, subject to chapter 120, may disapprove without the 60-day notification any rate increase filed by an insurer within the prohibited time period or during the time that the legality of the increased rate is being contested.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the office finds that a rate or rate change is excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory, the office shall issue an order of disapproval specifying that a new rate or rate schedule, which responds to the findings of the office, be filed by the insurer. The office shall further order, for any “use and file” filing made in accordance with subparagraph (a)2., that premiums charged each policyholder constituting the portion of the rate above that which was actuarially justified be returned to the policyholder in the form of a credit or refund. If the office finds that an insurer’s rate or rate change is inadequate, the new rate or rate schedule filed with the office in response to such a finding is applicable only to new or renewal business of the insurer written on or after the effective date of the responsive filing.</Text>

		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As amended by s. 12, ch. 2011-39. For a description of multiple acts in the same session affecting a statutory provision, <Font xml:space="preserve" Style="Italic">see</Font> preface to the <Font xml:space="preserve" Style="Italic">Florida Statutes</Font>, “Statutory Construction.” Subparagraph (3)(d)3. was also amended by s. 1, ch. 2011-160, and that version reads:</Text>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">3. An insurer must notify the office of any changes to rates for insurance and risks described in subparagraph 1. no later than 30 days after the effective date of the change. The notice must include the name of the insurer, the type or kind of insurance subject to rate change, and the average statewide percentage change in rates. Actuarial data with regard to rates for risks described in subparagraph 1. written by an insurer shall be maintained by the insurer for 2 years after the effective date of changes to those rates and are subject to examination by the office. The office may require the insurer to incur the costs associated with an examination. Upon examination, the office shall, in accordance with generally accepted and reasonable actuarial techniques, consider the rate factors in paragraphs (2)(b), (c), and (d) and the standards in paragraph (2)(e) to determine if the rate is excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.</Text>
