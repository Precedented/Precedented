All amounts received by the company which are required by contract to be applied to provide variable benefits or values shall be added to the appropriate separate account. If so provided under applicable contracts, that portion of the assets of any such separate account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with respect to the account shall not be chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the company may conduct. Any deficit from mortality experience which may arise in any such separate account shall be adjusted by additions to the account by the company so that the assets of the account are always at least equal to the assets required to satisfy the obligations of the company.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 61-441; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 1, ch. 73-30; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 587, 593, 809(2nd), ch. 82-243; s. 79, ch. 82-386; s. 114, ch. 92-318.</History></Section>
