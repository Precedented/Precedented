The agreement for such extension or deferment must be in writing and signed by the parties thereto. The premium finance company may charge and contract for the payment of an extension or deferral charge by the insured and collect and receive the same; but such charge may not exceed an amount equal to 1 percent per month simple interest on the amount of the installment or installments, or part thereof, extended or deferred for the period of extension or deferral or $1, whichever is the greater amount.
