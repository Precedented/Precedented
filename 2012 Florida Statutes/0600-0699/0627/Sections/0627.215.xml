				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The data filed for the group shall be a consolidation of the data of the individual insurers of the group. However, an insurer may elect to consolidate commercial umbrella liability insurance data with commercial casualty insurance data or to separately file data for commercial umbrella liability insurance. Each insurer shall elect its method of filing commercial umbrella liability insurance at the time of filing data for accident year 1987 and shall thereafter continue filing under the same method. In the case of commercial umbrella liability insurance data reported separately, a separate excessive profits test shall be applied and the test period shall be 10 years. </Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each insurer group writing commercial property insurance or commercial casualty insurance shall also file a schedule of Florida loss and loss adjustment experience for each of the 3 years previous to the most recent accident year. The incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shall be valued as of December 31 of the first year following the latest accident year, developed to an ultimate basis, and at two 12-month intervals thereafter, each developed to an ultimate basis, so that a total of 3 evaluations will be provided for each accident year. For reporting purposes unrelated to determining excess profits, the loss and loss adjustment experience of each accident year shall continue to be reported until each accident year has been reported at eight stages of development.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each insurer group writing commercial umbrella liability insurance which elects to file separate data for such insurance shall also file a schedule of Florida loss and loss adjustment experience for each of the 10 years previous to the most recent accident year. The incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses shall be valued as of December 31 of the first year following the latest accident year, developed to an ultimate basis, and at nine 12-month intervals thereafter, each developed to an ultimate basis, so that a total of 10 evaluations will be provided for each accident year. </Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each insurer group’s underwriting gain or loss for each calendar-accident year shall be computed as follows: The sum of the accident-year incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses as of December 31 of the year, developed to an ultimate basis, plus the administrative and selling expenses incurred in the calendar year, plus policyholder dividends applicable to the calendar year, shall be subtracted from the calendar-year earned premium to determine the underwriting gain or loss.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Beginning with the July 1, 1991, report for commercial property insurance and commercial casualty insurance, an excessive profit has been realized if the net aggregate underwriting gain for these lines combined is greater than the net aggregate anticipated underwriting profit for these lines plus 5 percent of earned premiums for the 3 most recent calendar years for which data is to be filed under this section. For calculation purposes commercial property insurance and commercial casualty insurance shall be broken down into sublines in order to ascertain the anticipated underwriting profit factor versus the actual underwriting gain for the given subline.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Beginning with the July 1, 1998, report for commercial umbrella liability insurance, if an insurer has elected to file data separately for such insurance, an excessive profit has been realized if the underwriting gain for such insurance is greater than the anticipated underwriting profit for such insurance plus 5 percent of earned premiums for the 10 most recent calendar years for which data is to be filed under this section.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As used in this section with respect to any 3-year period, or with respect to any 10-year period in the case of commercial umbrella liability insurance, “anticipated underwriting profit” means the sum of the dollar amounts obtained by multiplying, for each rate filing of the insurer group in effect during such period, the earned premiums applicable to such rate filing during such period by the percentage factor included in such rate filing for profit and contingencies, such percentage factor having been determined with due recognition to investment income from funds generated by Florida business, except that the anticipated underwriting profit for the purposes of this section shall be calculated using a profit and contingencies factor that is not less than zero. Separate calculations need not be made for consecutive rate filings containing the same percentage factor for profits and contingencies.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the insurer group has realized an excessive profit, the office shall order a return of the excessive amounts after affording the insurer group an opportunity for hearing and otherwise complying with the requirements of chapter 120.
