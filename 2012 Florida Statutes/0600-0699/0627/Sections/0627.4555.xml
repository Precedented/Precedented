An insurer issuing a life insurance contract on or after October 1, 1997, shall notify the applicant of the right to designate a secondary addressee at the time of application for the policy, on a form provided by the insurer, and at any time the policy is in force, by submitting a written notice to the insurer containing the name and address of the secondary addressee. For purposes of any life insurance policy that provides a grace period of more than 51 days for nonpayment of premiums, the notice of impending lapse in coverage required by this section must be mailed to the policyowner and the secondary addressee at least 21 days before the expiration of the grace period provided in the policy. This section does not apply to any life insurance contract under which premiums are payable monthly or more frequently and are regularly collected by a licensed agent or are paid by credit card or any preauthorized check processing or automatic debit service of a financial institution.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 95-142; s. 11, ch. 97-292.</History></Section>
