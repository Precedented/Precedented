The Legislature finds that inappropriate utilization of emergency department services increases the overall cost of providing health care and these costs are ultimately borne by the hospital, the insured patients, and, many times, by the taxpayers of this state. Finally, the Legislature declares that the providers and insurers must share the responsibility of providing alternative treatment options to urgent care patients outside of the emergency department. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature to place the obligation for educating consumers and creating mechanisms for delivery of care that will decrease the overutilization of emergency service on health insurers and providers.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Health insurers shall provide on their websites information regarding appropriate utilization of emergency care services which shall include, but not be limited to, a list of alternative urgent care contracted providers, the types of services offered by these providers, and what to do in the event of a true emergency.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Health insurers shall develop community emergency department diversion programs. Such programs may include, at the discretion of the insurer, but not be limited to, enlisting providers to be on call to insurers after hours, coordinating care through local community resources, and providing incentives to providers for case management.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As a disincentive for insureds to inappropriately use emergency department services for nonemergency care, health insurers may require higher copayments for urgent care or primary care provided in an emergency department and higher copayments for use of out-of-network emergency departments. Higher copayments may not be charged for the utilization of the emergency department for emergency care. For the purposes of this section, the term “emergency care” has the same meaning as provided in s. 395.002 and shall include services provided to rule out an emergency medical condition.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 25, ch. 2004-297.</History></Section>
