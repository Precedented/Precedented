The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then-current policy year, except that the insurer may deduct, either from such loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining such cash surrender value, including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. However, as a condition for approval of a policy loan interest rate in excess of 6 percent per year, the office shall require the insurer to furnish such assurances as the office deems necessary that the interest rate on such loans will bear a reasonable relationship to other interest rates and that the holders of such policies will benefit through higher dividends or lower premiums, or both.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The policy may also provide that, if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due, such interest shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate and that, if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of loan value thereof, then the policy shall terminate and become void, but not until at least 30 days’ notice has been mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the insured or policyowner and of any assignee of record at the home office of the insurer.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for 6 months after application therefor.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This section does not apply to term policies or to term insurance benefits provided by riders or supplemental policy provisions.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 485, ch. 59-205; s. 3, ch. 76-168; ss. 1, 3, ch. 77-324; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 6, ch. 81-289; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 385, 404, 809(2nd), 810, ch. 82-243; s. 79, ch. 82-386; s. 114, ch. 92-318; s. 1127, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
