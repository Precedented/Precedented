			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">As used in this section, the term:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Change in policy terms” means the modification, addition, or deletion of any term, coverage, duty, or condition from the previous policy. The correction of typographical or scrivener’s errors or the application of mandated legislative changes is not a change in policy terms.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Policy” means a written contract of property and casualty insurance or written agreement for such insurance, by whatever name called, and includes all clauses, riders, endorsements, and papers that are a part of such policy. The term does not include a binder as defined in s. 627.420 unless the duration of the binder period exceeds 60 days.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Renewal” means the issuance and delivery by an insurer of a policy superseding at the end of the policy period a policy previously issued and delivered by the same insurer or the issuance and delivery of a certificate or notice extending the term of a policy beyond its policy period or term. Any policy that has a policy period or term of less than 6 months or that does not have a fixed expiration date shall, for purposes of this section, be considered as written for successive policy periods or terms of 6 months.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A renewal policy may contain a change in policy terms. If a renewal policy does contain such change, the insurer must give the named insured written notice of the change, which must be enclosed along with the written notice of renewal premium required by ss. 627.4133 and 627.728. Such notice shall be entitled “Notice of Change in Policy Terms.”</Text>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="3">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Although not required, proof of mailing or registered mailing through the United States Postal Service of the Notice of Change in Policy Terms to the named insured at the address shown in the policy is sufficient proof of notice.</Text>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="4">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Receipt of the premium payment for the renewal policy by the insurer is deemed to be acceptance of the new policy terms by the named insured.</Text>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="5">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If an insurer fails to provide the notice required in subsection (2), the original policy terms remain in effect until the next renewal and the proper service of the notice, or until the effective date of replacement coverage obtained by the named insured, whichever occurs first.</Text>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="6">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The intent of this section is to:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Allow an insurer to make a change in policy terms without nonrenewing those policyholders that the insurer wishes to continue insuring.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Alleviate concern and confusion to the policyholder caused by the required policy nonrenewal for the limited issue if an insurer intends to renew the insurance policy, but the new policy contains a change in policy terms.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Encourage policyholders to discuss their coverages with their insurance agents.</Text>
