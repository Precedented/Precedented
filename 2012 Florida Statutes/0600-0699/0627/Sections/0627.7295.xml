				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A licensed general lines agent may charge a per-policy fee not to exceed $10 to cover the administrative costs of the agent associated with selling the motor vehicle insurance policy if the policy covers only personal injury protection coverage as provided by s. 627.736 and property damage liability coverage as provided by s. 627.7275 and if no other insurance is sold or issued in conjunction with or collateral to the policy.

			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">To the extent that a licensed general agent’s cost of obtaining motor vehicle reports on applicants for motor vehicle insurance is not otherwise compensated, the agent may, in addition to any other fees authorized by law, charge an applicant for motor vehicle insurance a reasonable, nonrefundable fee to reimburse the agent the actual cost of obtaining the report for each licensed driver when the motor vehicle report is obtained by the agent simultaneously with the preparation of the application for use in the calculation of premium or in the proper placement of the risk. The amount of the fee may not exceed the agent’s actual cost in obtaining the report which is not otherwise compensated. Actual cost is the cost of obtaining the report on an individual driver basis when so obtained or the pro rata cost per driver when the report is obtained on more than one driver; however, in no case may actual cost include subscription or access fees associated with obtaining motor vehicle reports online through any electronic transmissions program.</Text>

An insurer, agent, or premium finance company may not, directly or indirectly, take any action resulting in the insured having paid from the insured’s own funds an amount less than the 2 months’ premium required by this subsection. This subsection applies without regard to whether the premium is financed by a premium finance company or is paid pursuant to a periodic payment plan of an insurer or an insurance agent. This subsection does not apply if an insured or member of the insured’s family is renewing or replacing a policy or a binder for such policy written by the same insurer or a member of the same insurer group. This subsection does not apply to an insurer that issues private passenger motor vehicle coverage primarily to active duty or former military personnel or their dependents. This subsection does not apply if all policy payments are paid pursuant to a payroll deduction plan or an automatic electronic funds transfer payment plan from the policyholder. This subsection and subsection (4) do not apply if all policy payments to an insurer are paid pursuant to an automatic electronic funds transfer payment plan from an agent, a managing general agent, or a premium finance company and if the policy includes, at a minimum, personal injury protection pursuant to ss. 627.730-627.7405; motor vehicle property damage liability pursuant to s. 627.7275; and bodily injury liability in at least the amount of $10,000 because of bodily injury to, or death of, one person in any one accident and in the amount of $20,000 because of bodily injury to, or death of, two or more persons in any one accident.
