If the agent or agency is an agent or agency for two or more title insurers, any liability shall be borne by the title insurer upon which a title insurance commitment or policy was issued prior to the illegal act. If no commitment or policy was issued, each title insurer represented by the agent or agency at the time of the illegal act shares in the liability in the same proportion that the premium remitted to it by the agent or agency during the 1-year period before the illegal act bears to the total premium remitted to all title insurers by the agent or agency during the same time period.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 25, ch. 85-185; s. 1, ch. 86-81; s. 1, ch. 86-286; ss. 107, 114, ch. 92-318; s. 21, ch. 99-286.</History></Section>
