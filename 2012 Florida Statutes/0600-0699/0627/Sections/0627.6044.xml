The estimate may be in the form of a range of payments or an average payment. The insurer may require the insured to provide detailed information regarding the procedure or service to be performed, including the procedure or service code number provided by the health care provider and the health care provider’s estimated charge. An insurer that provides an insured with a good faith estimate is not bound by the estimate. However, a pattern of providing estimates that vary significantly from the ultimate insurance payment constitutes a violation of this code.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 9, 12, ch. 91-296; ss. 55, 114, ch. 92-318; s. 340, ch. 97-102.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 627.6145.</Text></Note></Section>
