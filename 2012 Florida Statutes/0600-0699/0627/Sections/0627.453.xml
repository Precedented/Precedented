The payment may, at the option of the insurer, be subject to an interest charge not in excess of 8 percent per year for the number of days of grace elapsing before the payment of the premium, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in force. If the policy becomes a claim during the grace period before the overdue premium is paid, or the deferred premiums of the current policy year, if any, are paid, the amount of such premium or premiums with interest not in excess of 8 percent per year thereon may be deducted in any settlement under the policy.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 480, ch. 59-205; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 380, 404, 809(2nd), ch. 82-243; s. 79, ch. 82-386; s. 114, ch. 92-318.</History></Section>
