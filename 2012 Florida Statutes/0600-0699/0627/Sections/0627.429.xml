A test which is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or by the federal Food and Drug Administration is reliable for the purposes of this section. A test which is rejected or not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the federal Food and Drug Administration is not reliable for the purposes of this section. If a specific test recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the federal Food and Drug Administration indicates the existence or potential existence of exposure to the HIV infection or a sickness or medical condition related to the HIV infection, the insurer shall, before relying on a single test result to deny or limit coverage or to rate the coverage, follow the applicable Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or federal Food and Drug Administration recommended test protocol and shall use any applicable followup tests or series of tests recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or federal Food and Drug Administration to confirm the indication.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Prior to testing, the insurer shall disclose its intent to test the person for the HIV infection or for a specific sickness or medical condition derived therefrom and shall obtain the person’s written informed consent to administer the test. The written informed consent required by this paragraph shall include a fair explanation of the test, including its purpose, potential uses, and limitations, and the meaning of its results and the right to confidential treatment of information. Use of a form approved by the office raises a conclusive presumption of informed consent.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An applicant shall be notified of a positive test result by a physician designated by the applicant or, in the absence of such designation, by the Department of Health. Notification must include all of the following:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Face-to-face posttest counseling on the meaning of the test results, the possible need for additional testing, and the need to eliminate behavior which might spread the disease to others.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The availability in the person’s geographic area of any appropriate health care services, including mental health care, and appropriate social and support services.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The benefits of locating and counseling any individual by whom the infected individual may have been exposed to human immunodeficiency virus and any individual whom the infected individual may have exposed to the virus.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The availability, if any, of the services of public health authorities with respect to locating and counseling any individual described in subparagraph 3.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A medical test for exposure to the HIV infection or for a sickness or medical condition derived from such infection may be required of or given to a person only if the test is based on the person’s current medical condition or medical history or if the test is triggered by threshold coverage amounts which apply to all persons within the risk class. Sexual orientation may not be used in the underwriting process or in the determination of which applicants shall be tested for exposure to the HIV infection. The marital status, living arrangements, occupation, gender, beneficiary designation, or zip code or other territorial classification of an applicant may not be used to establish the applicant’s sexual orientation.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer may inquire whether a person has been tested positive for exposure to the HIV infection or been diagnosed as having ARC or AIDS caused by the HIV infection or other sickness or condition derived from such infection.

The insurer may not disclose information regarding specific test results outside of the insurance company or its employees, insurance affiliates, agents, or reinsurers, except to the person tested and to persons designated in writing by the person tested. The insurer may not furnish specific test results for exposure to the HIV infection to an insurer industry data bank if a review of the information would identify the individual and the specific test results.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="g"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A laboratory may be used by an insurer or insurance support organization for the processing of HIV-related tests only if it is certified by the United States Department of Health and Human Services under the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act of 1967, permitting testing of specimens obtained in interstate commerce, and only if the laboratory subjects itself to ongoing proficiency testing by the College of American Pathologists, the American Association of Bio Analysts, or an equivalent program approved by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States Department of Health and Human Services.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">RESTRICTIONS ON COVERAGE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS.<EmDash /></Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer of a group policy may not exclude coverage of an eligible individual because of a positive test result for exposure to the HIV infection or a specific sickness or medical condition derived from such exposure, either as a condition for or subsequent to the issuance of the policy.
