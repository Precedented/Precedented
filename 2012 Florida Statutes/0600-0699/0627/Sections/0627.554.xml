A policy issued to the trustees of a fund established in this state by a labor union may provide that the trustees or their employees, or both, may be insured under the policy if their duties are principally connected with such trusteeship.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder either wholly from the policyholder’s funds or from funds contributed by the employer or employers of the insured persons or by the labor union, or by both, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance must insure all eligible members, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer or except as to those who reject the coverage in writing.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The amounts of insurance under the policy must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the members or by the union.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 527, ch. 59-205; s. 1, ch. 61-107; s. 2, ch. 63-187; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 425, 448, 809(2nd), ch. 82-243; s. 79, ch. 82-386; ss. 48, 114, ch. 92-318.</History></Section>
