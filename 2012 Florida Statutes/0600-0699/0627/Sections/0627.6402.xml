The rebate may be based on premiums paid in the last calendar year or the last policy year. The individual must provide evidence of demonstrative maintenance or improvement of the individual’s health status as determined by assessments of agreed-upon health status indicators between the individual and the health insurer, including, but not limited to, reduction in weight, body mass index, and smoking cessation. Any rebate provided by the health insurer is presumed to be appropriate unless credible data demonstrates otherwise, or unless such rebate program requires the insured to incur costs to qualify for the rebate which equal or exceed the value of the rebate, but in no event shall the rebate exceed 10 percent of paid premiums.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The premium rebate authorized by this section shall be effective for an insured on an annual basis, unless the individual fails to maintain or improve his or her health status while participating in an approved wellness program, or credible evidence demonstrates that the individual is not participating in the approved wellness program.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 33, ch. 2004-297; s. 5, ch. 2005-231.</History></Section>
