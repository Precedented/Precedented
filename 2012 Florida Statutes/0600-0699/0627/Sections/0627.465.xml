If a claim arises under the contract on account of death prior to expiration of the period of grace before the overdue payment to the insurer or the deferred payments of the current contract year, if any, are paid, the amount of such payments, with interest on any overdue payments, may be deducted from any amount payable under the contract in settlement.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 492, ch. 59-205; s. 11, ch. 61-441; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 390, 404, 809(2nd), ch. 82-243; s. 79, ch. 82-386; s. 114, ch. 92-318.</History></Section>
