If, in the opinion of the office, any advertisement by a Medicare supplement policy insurer violates any of the provisions of part IX of chapter 626 or any rule of the commission, the office may enter an immediate order requiring that the use of the advertisement be discontinued. If requested by the insurer, the office shall conduct a hearing within 10 days of the entry of such order. If, after the hearing or by agreement with the insurer, a final determination is made that the advertising was in fact violative of any provision of part IX of chapter 626 or of any rule of the commission, the office may, in lieu of revocation of the certificate of authority, require the publication of a corrective advertisement; impose an administrative penalty of up to $10,000; and, in the case of an initial solicitation, require that the insurer, prior to accepting any application received in response to the advertisement, provide an acceptable clarification of the advertisement to each individual applicant.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 6, 7, ch. 86-271; s. 93, ch. 89-360; s. 114, ch. 92-318; s. 61, ch. 2001-63; s. 1172, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
