For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The term “indorser” means a person who makes an indorsement.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder’s name or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 92-82.</History></Section>
