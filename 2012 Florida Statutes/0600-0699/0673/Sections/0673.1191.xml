If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that failure to do so will bind the person notified in an action later brought by the person giving the notice as to any determination of fact common to the two litigations, the person notified is so bound unless after seasonable receipt of the notice the person notified does come in and defend.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 92-82.</History></Section>
