If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of s. 673.1041(1); but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 92-82.</History></Section>
