If that proof is made, s. 673.3081 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 92-82; s. 1, ch. 2004-3.</History></Section>
