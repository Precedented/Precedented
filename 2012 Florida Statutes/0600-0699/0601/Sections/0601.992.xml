		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Citrus or the Department of Agriculture or their successors may collect or compel the entities regulated by the Department of Agriculture to collect dues, contributions, or any other financial payment upon request by, and on behalf of, any not-for-profit corporation and its related not-for-profit corporations located in this state that receive payments or dues from their members. Such not-for-profit corporation must be engaged, to the exclusion of agricultural commodities other than citrus, in market news and grower education solely for citrus growers, and must have at least 5,000 members who are engaged in growing citrus in this state for commercial sale. The Department of Agriculture may adopt rules to administer this section. The rules may establish indemnity requirements for the requesting corporation and for fees to be charged to the corporation that are sufficient but do not exceed the amount necessary to ensure that any direct costs incurred by the Department of Agriculture in implementing this section are borne by the requesting corporation and not by the Department of Agriculture.</Text>
