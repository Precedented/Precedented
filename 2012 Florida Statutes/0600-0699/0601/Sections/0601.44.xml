		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">All citrus fruit or processed citrus products prepared for sale or transportation, that are being prepared for such purpose, or that have been or are being delivered for sale or transportation that may be found immature or otherwise unfit for human consumption upon inspection and testing shall be seized and destroyed by a citrus fruit inspector or the sheriff of the county where found as may be provided by department rules. Such determination of immaturity or unfitness for human consumption may be made by a citrus fruit inspector at any place where such citrus fruit may be found after severance from the tree, and such seizure and destruction may likewise occur at any such place. However, in the event of seizure of citrus fruit upon the grounds that such citrus fruit fails to show a break in color required by this chapter or department rules for that particular variety of citrus fruit, the owner or person in charge of such citrus fruit shall be allowed to separate and retain for subsequent use, in accordance with this chapter or department rules, that portion of such citrus fruit which shows a break in color required by this chapter or department rules for that particular variety, and in such case, only that portion thereof which fails to show a break in color for such variety, as required by this chapter or department rules, shall be destroyed by a citrus fruit inspector or the sheriff of the county, as may be prescribed by department rules.</Text>
