		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When any dispute as to quality, grade, or condition of citrus fruit or the canned or concentrated products thereof arises, the shipper or any financially interested person may call in at his, her, or its expense an inspector licensed or certified only by the United States Department of Agriculture to inspect such citrus fruit or its canned or concentrated products. Such inspector shall issue a regular official certificate to the applicant showing the quality, grade, and condition thereof, and in all cases, such certificate shall be prima facie evidence. If such certificate shows that the citrus fruit or the canned or concentrated products thereof conform to the requirements of this chapter and the rules or orders of the Department of Citrus and of the Department of Agriculture, such shipper or such financially interested person may present the original certificate to the person or representative of the person having charge of the vehicle of transportation by which such citrus fruit or the canned or concentrated products thereof are to be transported, which person or representative shall then accept such citrus fruit or the canned or concentrated products thereof for shipment provided that all other provisions of this chapter and of the rules and orders of the Department of Citrus and of the Department of Agriculture have been met and complied with.</Text>
