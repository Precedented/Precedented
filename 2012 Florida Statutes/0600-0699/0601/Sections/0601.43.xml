		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any oranges, grapefruit, tangerines, and citrus hybrids not conforming to the minimum maturity requirements set forth in department rules are deemed and held to be immature and unfit for human consumption. In the testing of fruit to determine whether the same conforms to such requirements, any inspector has the right and authority to test the individual fruit in any given sample of fruit drawn in the number and by the manner as prescribed by department rules. If, upon testing the juice of individual fruit in any sample, more than 10 percent of such individual fruit fail by more than one-half percentage point to meet the minimum ratio of total soluble solids to anhydrous citric acid that is required for such fruit, all of the fruit in the lot from which the sample was drawn is deemed and shall be held to be immature and unfit for human consumption.</Text>
