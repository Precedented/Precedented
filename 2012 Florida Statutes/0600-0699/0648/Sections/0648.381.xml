The failure of an applicant to pass an examination or the failure to appear for the examination or to take or complete the examination does not preclude the applicant from taking subsequent examinations. A person who fails an examination three times must retake the 120-hour course and obtain a grade of 80 percent or higher before sitting for the examination again.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 18, 47, ch. 90-131; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 18, ch. 96-372; s. 11, ch. 2002-260.</History></Section>
