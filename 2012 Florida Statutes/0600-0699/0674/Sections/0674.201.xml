This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff. If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection, or return, the relevant provisions of this chapter apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">After an item has been indorsed with the words “pay any bank” or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Returned to the customer initiating collection; or</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-254; s. 19, ch. 92-82.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">s. 4-201, U.C.C.</Text></Note></Section>
