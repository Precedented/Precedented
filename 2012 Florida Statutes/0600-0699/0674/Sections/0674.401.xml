The notice is effective for the period stated in s. 674.403(2) for stop-payment orders and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in s. 674.303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under s. 674.402.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The original terms of the altered item; or</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed, unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-254; s. 38, ch. 92-82.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">s. 4-401, U.C.C.; supersedes ss. 674.15-674.17, 675.32.</Text></Note></Section>
