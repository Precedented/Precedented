Refusal to pay or accept because the goods have not arrived is not dishonor; the bank must notify its transferor of the refusal but need not present the draft again until it is instructed to do so or learns of the arrival of the goods.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-254; s. 46, ch. 92-82.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">s. 4-502, U.C.C.</Text></Note></Section>
