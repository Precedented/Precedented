Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a funds-transfer system rule governing rights and obligations between participating banks using the system may be effective even if the rule conflicts with this chapter and indirectly affects another party to the funds transfer that does not consent to the rule. A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in ss. 670.404(3), 670.405(4), and 670.507(3).</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 91-70.</History></Section>
