A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications canceling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations, or amendments or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations, or amendments. A cut-off time may apply to senders generally, or different cut-off times may apply to different senders or categories of payment orders. If a payment order or communication canceling or amending a payment order is received after the close of a funds-transfer business day or after the appropriate cut-off time on a funds-transfer business day, the receiving bank may treat the payment order or communication as received at the opening of the next funds-transfer business day.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If this chapter refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this chapter.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 91-70; s. 23, ch. 2007-134.</History></Section>
