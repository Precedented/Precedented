Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in s. 670.209, and liability is limited to that provided in this chapter. A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this chapter or by express agreement.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 91-70.</History></Section>
