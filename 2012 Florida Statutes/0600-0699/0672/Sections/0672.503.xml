The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this chapter, and in particular:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved:</Text>

			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably objects, and, except as otherwise provided in chapter 679, receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer’s rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.</Text>
