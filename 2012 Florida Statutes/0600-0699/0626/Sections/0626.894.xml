In no event may such fine exceed an aggregate amount of $5,000 for all nonwillful violations arising out of the same action. When an administrator discovers a nonwillful violation, the administrator shall correct the violation and, if restitution is due, the restitution shall include interest at the rate of 12 percent per year from either the date of the violation or the date of inception of the policy of the affected person, at the option of the administrator. The restitution may be a credit against future premiums due, provided that the interest shall accumulate until the premiums are due. If the amount of restitution due to any person is $50 or more, and the administrator wishes to credit it against future premiums, the administrator shall notify such person that he or she may receive a check instead of a credit. If the credit is on a policy which is not renewed, the administrator shall pay the restitution to the person to whom it is due.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">With respect to any knowing and willful violation of a lawful order or rule of the office or commission or a provision of this part, the office may impose a fine upon the administrator in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each such violation. In no event may such fine exceed an aggregate amount of $25,000 for all knowing and willful violations arising out of the same action. In addition to such fine, the administrator shall make restitution when due in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2).</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The failure of an administrator to make restitution when due as required under this section constitutes a willful violation of this part. However, if an administrator in good faith is uncertain as to whether any restitution is due or as to the amount of restitution due, it shall promptly notify the office of the circumstances; and the failure to make restitution pending a determination of whether restitution is due or the amount of restitution due will not constitute a violation of this part.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 83-203; s. 3, ch. 84-94; s. 12, ch. 85-62; ss. 206, 207, ch. 90-363; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 294, ch. 97-102; s. 1003, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
