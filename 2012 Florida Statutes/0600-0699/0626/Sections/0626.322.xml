The department may, upon request of the applicant and the insurer on application forms furnished by the department and upon payment of fees as prescribed in s. 624.501, issue a license and appointment to such person. By authorizing the effectuation of an appointment for a license, the insurer is thereby certifying to the department that the applicant has the necessary training to hold himself or herself out as a life insurance representative, and the insurer shall further certify that it is willing to be bound by the acts of such applicant within the scope of his or her employment. Appointments shall be continued as prescribed in s. 626.381 and upon payment of a fee as prescribed in s. 624.501, unless sooner terminated. Such fees received shall be credited to the Insurance Regulatory Trust Fund as provided for in s. 624.523.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-545; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 3, ch. 81-282; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 176, 217, 807, 810, ch. 82-243; s. 22, ch. 82-386; ss. 33, 206, 207, ch. 90-363; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 223, ch. 97-102; s. 931, ch. 2003-261; s. 33, ch. 2003-267; s. 26, ch. 2003-281.</History></Section>
