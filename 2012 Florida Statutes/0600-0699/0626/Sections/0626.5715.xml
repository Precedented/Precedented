<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0626.5715" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Parity of regulation of insurance agents and agencies.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Insurance Code requirements apply equally to all insurance transactions as between an insurance agency owned by or an agent associated with a federally chartered financial institution, an insurance agency owned by or an agent associated with a state-chartered financial institution, and an insurance agency owned by or an agent associated with an entity that is not a financial institution. Except as provided in the code, one insurance agency or agent is not subject to more stringent or less stringent regulation than another insurance agency or agent on the basis of the regulatory status of the entity that owns the agency or is associated with the agent. For the purposes of this section, a person is “associated with” another entity if the person is employed by, retained by, under contract to, or owned or controlled by the entity directly or indirectly. This section does not apply with respect to a financial institution that is prohibited from owning an insurance agency or that is prohibited from being associated with an insurance agent under state or federal law.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 96-168; s. 10, ch. 2001-142.</History></Section>
