		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">No life agent shall, with respect to the placement of life insurance coverage with a life insurer covering the life of a person who is not a family member of the agent, handle in his or her capacity as a life agent the placement of such coverage when the agent placing the coverage or a family member of such agent is the named beneficiary under the life insurance policy, unless the life agent or family member has an insurable interest in the life of such person. However, the agent or a family member of such agent may not be designated as a trustee or guardian or be granted power of attorney unless he or she is a family member of the policy owner or insured, or is a bank or trust company duly authorized to act as a fiduciary. For the purposes of this section, the phrase “not a family member,” with respect to a life agent, means an individual who is not related to the life agent as father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, grandfather, grandmother, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, niece, husband, wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, stepfather, stepmother, stepson, stepdaughter, stepbrother, stepsister, half brother, or half sister. For the purposes of this section, the term “insurable interest” means that the life agent has an actual, lawful, and substantial economic interest in the safety and preservation of the life of the insured or a reasonable expectation of benefit or advantage from the continued life of the insured.</Text>
