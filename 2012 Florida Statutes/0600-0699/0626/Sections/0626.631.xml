The licensee may subsequently request a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57, and the department shall expedite any such requested hearing. The sole issue at such hearing shall be whether the revocation should be rescinded because such person was not in fact convicted of a violation of this code or a felony.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The papers, documents, reports, or evidence of the department relative to a hearing for revocation or suspension of a license or appointment pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and chapter 120 are confidential and exempt from the provisions of s. 119.07(1) until after the same have been published at the hearing. However, such papers, documents, reports, or items of evidence are subject to discovery in a hearing for revocation or suspension of a license or appointment.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 242, ch. 59-205; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 14, ch. 71-86; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 21, ch. 78-95; s. 3, ch. 81-282; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 208, 217, 807, 810, ch. 82-243; ss. 58, 206, 207, ch. 90-363; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 16, ch. 92-146; s. 5, ch. 93-80; s. 373, ch. 96-406; s. 269, ch. 96-410; s. 949, ch. 2003-261; s. 47, ch. 2004-390.</History></Section>
