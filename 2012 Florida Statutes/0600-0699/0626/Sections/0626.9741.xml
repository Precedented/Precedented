A credit score alone, as calculated by a credit reporting agency or by or for the insurer, may not be considered a credit report.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Credit score” means a score, grade, or value that is derived by using any or all data from a credit report in any type of model, method, or program, whether electronically, in an algorithm, computer software or program, or any other process, for the purpose of grading or ranking credit report data.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Tier” means a category within a single insurer into which insureds with substantially similar risk, exposure, or expense factors are placed for purposes of determining rate or premium.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer must inform an applicant or insured, in the same medium as the application is taken, that a credit report or score is being requested for underwriting or rating purposes. An insurer that makes an adverse decision based, in whole or in part, upon a credit report must provide at no charge, a copy of the credit report to the applicant or insured or provide the applicant or insured with the name, address, and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency from which the insured or applicant may obtain the credit report. The insurer must provide notification to the consumer explaining the reasons for the adverse decision. The reasons must be provided in sufficiently clear and specific language so that a person can identify the basis for the insurer’s adverse decision. Such notification shall include a description of the four primary reasons, or such fewer number as existed, which were the primary influences of the adverse decision. The use of generalized terms such as “poor credit history,” “poor credit rating,” or “poor insurance score” does not meet the explanation requirements of this subsection. A credit score may not be used in underwriting or rating insurance unless the scoring process produces information in sufficient detail to permit compliance with the requirements of this subsection. It shall not be deemed an adverse decision if, due to the insured’s credit report or credit score, the insured continues to receive a less favorable rate or placement in a less favorable tier or company at the time of renewal except for renewals or reunderwriting required by this section.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer may not request a credit report or score based upon the race, color, religion, marital status, age, gender, income, national origin, or place of residence of the applicant or insured.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer may not make an adverse decision solely because of information contained in a credit report or score without consideration of any other underwriting or rating factor.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer may not make an adverse decision or use a credit score that could lead to such a decision if based, in whole or in part, on:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The absence of, or an insufficient, credit history, in which instance the insurer shall:</Text><SubSubParagraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Treat the consumer as otherwise approved by the Office of Insurance Regulation if the insurer presents information that such an absence or inability is related to the risk for the insurer;</Text></SubSubParagraph><SubSubParagraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Treat the consumer as if the applicant or insured had neutral credit information, as defined by the insurer;</Text></SubSubParagraph><SubSubParagraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Exclude the use of credit information as a factor and use only other underwriting criteria;</Text></SubSubParagraph></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Collection accounts with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s credit report;</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Place of residence; or</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any other circumstance that the Financial Services Commission determines, by rule, lacks sufficient statistical correlation and actuarial justification as a predictor of insurance risk.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer may use the number of credit inquiries requested or made regarding the applicant or insured except for:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Credit inquiries not initiated by the consumer or inquiries requested by the consumer for his or her own credit information.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Inquiries relating to insurance coverage, if so identified on a consumer’s credit report.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Collection accounts with a medical industry code, if so identified on the consumer’s credit report.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s credit report as being from the home mortgage industry and made within 30 days of one another, unless only one inquiry is considered.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Multiple lender inquiries, if coded by the consumer reporting agency on the consumer’s credit report as being from the automobile lending industry and made within 30 days of one another, unless only one inquiry is considered.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An insurer must, upon the request of an applicant or insured, provide a means of appeal for an applicant or insured whose credit report or credit score is unduly influenced by a dissolution of marriage, the death of a spouse, or temporary loss of employment.
