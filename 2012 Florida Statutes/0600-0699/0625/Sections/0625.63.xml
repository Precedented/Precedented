The commission or department may by rule prescribe the general form of such notice, shall specify the insurer’s name, or may list such names when more than one request is pending at the same time. Such notice shall state therein that such insurer or insurers have petitioned for the release and return of deposits pursuant to and in compliance with s. 625.62 and this section; that the office or department has no information upon which to base a finding that the insurer or insurers named in the notice are not lawfully entitled to obtain the release and return of such deposits; and that, unless such information is presented to it within 90 days from the date specified in the notice, such deposits must be returned to the insurer or insurers. In the event that no such information is presented to the office or department within such 90-day period, it shall thereupon release and return the deposit or deposits as requested by the insurer or insurers whose request was not challenged.
