In no event shall such fine exceed an aggregate amount of $5,000 for all nonwillful violations arising out of the same action. When an insurer discovers a nonwillful violation, the insurer shall correct the violation and, if restitution is due, make restitution to all affected persons. Such restitution shall include interest at 12 percent per year from either the date of the violation or the date of inception of the affected person’s policy, at the insurer’s option. The restitution may be a credit against future premiums due provided that the interest on the restitution will accumulate until the premiums are due. If the amount of restitution due to any person is $50 or more and the insurer wishes to credit it against future premiums, the insurer shall notify such person that it wishes to do so but that the person may receive a check instead of a credit. If the credit is on a policy which is not renewed, the insurer shall pay the restitution to the person to whom it is due.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">With respect to any knowing and willful violation of an order or rule of the office or commission or a provision of this chapter, the office may impose a fine upon the insurer in an amount not to exceed $5,000 for each such violation. In no event shall such fine exceed an aggregate amount of $25,000 for all knowing and willful violations arising out of the same action. In addition to such fines, such insurer shall make restitution when due in accordance with the provisions of subsection (2).</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The failure of an insurer to make restitution when due as required under this section constitutes a willful violation of this chapter. However, if an insurer in good faith is uncertain as to whether any restitution is due or as to the amount of such restitution, it shall promptly notify the office of the circumstances, and the failure to make restitution pending a determination thereof will not constitute a violation of this chapter.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 12, 21, ch. 83-278; ss. 6, 7, ch. 93-147; s. 1645, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
