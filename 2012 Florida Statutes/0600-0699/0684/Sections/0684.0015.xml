			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If an arbitrator becomes de jure or de facto unable to perform his or her functions or for other reasons fails to act without undue delay, his or her mandate terminates if he or she withdraws from office or if the parties agree on the termination. Otherwise, if a controversy remains concerning any of these grounds, any party may request the court specified in s. 684.0008 to decide on the termination of the mandate. The decision of the court is not appealable.</Text>
