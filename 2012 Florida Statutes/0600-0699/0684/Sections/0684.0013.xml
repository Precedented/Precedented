			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An arbitrator may be challenged only if circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator’s impartiality or independence, or if the arbitrator does not possess qualifications agreed to by the parties. A party may challenge an arbitrator appointed by it, or in whose appointment the party participated, only for reasons of which the party became aware after the appointment was made.</Text>
