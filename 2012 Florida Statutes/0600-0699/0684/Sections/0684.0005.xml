			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, a written communication is deemed to be received if it is delivered to the addressee personally or if it is delivered to the addressee’s place of business, habitual residence, or mailing address. If one of these locations cannot be found after a reasonable inquiry, the written communication is deemed to be received if it is sent to the addressee’s last known place of business, habitual residence, or mailing address by registered letter or any other means that provides a record of the attempt to deliver it. The communication is deemed to be received on the day it is delivered.</Text>
