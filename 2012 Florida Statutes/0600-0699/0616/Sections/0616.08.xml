		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each fair association shall hold, conduct, and operate public fairs and expositions, including an annual public fair. For that purpose, a fair association may buy, lease, acquire, and occupy lands and erect buildings and improvements of any kind on those lands; sell, mortgage, lease, license, or convey any such property or any part thereof, in its discretion, from time to time for the purpose of public fairs or expositions; charge and receive compensation for admission to those public fairs and expositions, and grant a lease or license or rent space for exhibits, concessions, and other purposes; conduct and hold public meetings; supervise and conduct lectures and demonstration work in connection with or for the improvement of agriculture, horticulture, stockraising and poultry raising, and all kinds of farming and related matters; hold exhibits of agricultural and horticultural products and livestock, poultry, equine, and other domestic animals; give certificates or diplomas of excellence; promote the progress of the geographical area it represents and serves and stimulate public interest in the advantages and development of that area by providing facilities for the benefit and development of the educational, agricultural, horticultural, livestock, equestrian, charitable, historical, civic, cultural, scientific, and other resources of the state, any county of the state, or any municipality or other community of any county of the state, including facilities for exhibits, concessions, industrial exhibitions, public gatherings, cultural activities, entertainment events, recreational vehicle parking, auctions, trade shows, concerts, and other functions that the association determines will enhance the educational, physical, economic, and cultural interests of the public; and generally do, perform, and carry out all matters, acts, and business usual or proper in connection with public fairs and expositions. This enumeration of particular powers does not diminish or limit any special provisions of the charter of the association for the regulation of its business, and the conduct of its affairs of creating, defining, limiting, and regulating the powers of the association or its officers or members. The treasurer or similar officer of the association shall give a good and sufficient bond with a surety company duly authorized under the laws of the state, payable to the association and in an amount equal to the value of the total amount of money and other property in that officer’s possession or custody, in addition to the value of any money and property of the association which may reasonably be expected to come into that officer’s possession or custody. A fair association organized under this chapter is a noncommercial activity provider.</Text>
