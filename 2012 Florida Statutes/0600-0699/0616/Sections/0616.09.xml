Any fair association which violates any such law or which knowingly permits the violation of any such law is subject to forfeiture of its charter; and if any citizen complains to the Department of Legal Affairs that the association was organized for or is being used as a cover to evade any of the laws of Florida against crime, and submits prima facie evidence to sustain the charge, the Department of Legal Affairs shall institute, and in due time prosecute to final judgment, such proceedings as may be necessary to annul the charter and incorporation of the association. A writ of injunction or other extraordinary process shall be issued by a court of competent jurisdiction on the application of the Department of Legal Affairs on complaint pending the annulment proceeding and in aid thereof, and the case shall be given precedence over all civil cases pending in that court and shall be heard and disposed of with as little delay as practicable.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 7388, 1917; RGS 4525; CGL 6524; s. 2, ch. 29737, 1955; s. 4, ch. 63-247; ss. 11, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 25, 26, ch. 83-239; ss. 11, 44, ch. 93-168.</History></Section>
