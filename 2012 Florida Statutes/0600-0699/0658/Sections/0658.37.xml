No bank or trust company shall declare any dividend at any time at which its net income from the current year combined with the retained net income from the preceding 2 years is a loss or which would cause the capital accounts of the bank or trust company to fall below the minimum amount required by law, regulation, order, or any written agreement with the office or a state or federal regulatory agency. A bank or trust company may, however, split up or divide the issued shares of capital stock into a greater number of shares without increasing or decreasing the capital accounts of the bank or trust company, and such shall not be construed to be a dividend within the meaning of this section.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A bank that has been determined to be imminently insolvent may not pay a dividend.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 28016, 1953; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 27, 151, 152, ch. 80-260; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; s. 18, ch. 89-229; s. 1, ch. 91-307; ss. 1, 121, ch. 92-303; s. 1783, ch. 2003-261; s. 17, ch. 2004-340; s. 100, ch. 2004-390.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 659.09.</Text></Note></Section>
