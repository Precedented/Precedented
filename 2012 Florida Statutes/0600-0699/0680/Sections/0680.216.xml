<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0680.216" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Third-party beneficiaries of express and implied warranties.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this chapter, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of the lessee or who is a guest in the lessee’s home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified, or limited; but an exclusion, modification, or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, which is effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 90-278.</History></Section>
