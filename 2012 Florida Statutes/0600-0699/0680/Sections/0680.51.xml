But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 90-278.</History></Section>
