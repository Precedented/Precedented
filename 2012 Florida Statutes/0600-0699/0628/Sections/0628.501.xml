The insurer may, and if a life insurer shall, make a reasonable classification of its policies so held by such members, and a formula based upon such classification, for determining the equitable distributive share of each such member. Such classification and formula shall be subject to the approval of the office.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 670, ch. 59-205; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 665, 809(1st), ch. 82-243; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 386, ch. 97-102; s. 1288, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
