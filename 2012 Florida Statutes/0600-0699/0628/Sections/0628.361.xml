Any such classification or determination shall be reasonable and shall not unfairly discriminate as between policyholders within the same such classification. A life insurer may issue both participating and nonparticipating policies only if the right or absence of right to participate is reasonably related to the premium charged.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">No dividend, otherwise earned, shall be made contingent upon the payment of renewal premium on any policy.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 656, ch. 59-205; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 665, 809(1st), ch. 82-243; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
