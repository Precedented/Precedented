The commission shall adopt rules establishing the information and form required for registration and the manner in which registered insurers and their affiliates are regulated. The rules apply to domestic insurers, foreign insurers, and commercially domiciled insurers, except for a foreign insurer domiciled in states that are accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners by December 31, 1995. Except to the extent of any conflict with this code, the rules must include all requirements and standards of ss. 4 and 5 of the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and the Insurance Holding Company System Model Regulation of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as the Regulatory Act and the Model Regulation existed on November 30, 2001, and may include a prohibition on oral contracts between affiliated entities. Upon request, the office may waive filing requirements under this section for a domestic insurer that is the subsidiary of an insurer that is in full compliance with the insurance holding company registration laws of its state of domicile, which state is accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 9, ch. 85-214; s. 1, ch. 86-286; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 23, ch. 93-410; s. 13, ch. 97-292; s. 1309, ch. 2003-261; s. 4, ch. 2007-138.</History></Section>
