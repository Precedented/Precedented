During the absence of such authority, the insurer shall not issue any policy without providing therein for the contingent liability of the policyholder, nor renew any policy which is renewable at the option of the insurer without endorsing the same to provide for such contingent liability. Such renewal or endorsement shall bear conspicuously on its face the provision for contingent liability of the policyholder.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 655, ch. 59-205; ss. 13, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 665, 809(1st), ch. 82-243; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 1274, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
