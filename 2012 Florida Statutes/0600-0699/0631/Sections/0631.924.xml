The stay may be extended for a period of time greater than 6 months upon proper application to a court of competent jurisdiction. The association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of the insured, may apply to have any judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or self-insurance fund or its failure to defend an insured set aside by the same court or administrator that made the judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding and may defend against the claim on the merits. If the association so requests, the stay of proceedings may be shortened or waived.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 20, ch. 97-262; s. 7, ch. 2003-267.</History></Section>
