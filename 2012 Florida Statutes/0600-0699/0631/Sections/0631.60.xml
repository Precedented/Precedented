Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this part shall cooperate with the association to the same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer. The association shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid out except such causes of action as the insolvent insurer would have had if such sums had been paid by the insolvent insurer. In the case of an insolvent insurer operating on a plan with assessment liability, payments of claims of the association shall not operate to reduce the liability of insureds to the receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor for unpaid assessments.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The receiver, liquidator, or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlements of covered claims by the association or a similar organization in another state.

The expenses of the association or similar organization in handling claims shall be accorded the same priority as the liquidator’s expenses.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The association shall periodically file with the receiver or liquidator of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the association and estimates of anticipated claims on the association which shall preserve the rights of the association against the assets of the insolvent insurer.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any release of the association and its insured must clearly state whether or not any claim filed with the receiver in excess of the liability of the association under s. 631.57 is waived.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 70-20; s. 11, ch. 71-970; s. 809(1st), ch. 82-243; s. 31, ch. 83-38; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 6, ch. 92-345; s. 412, ch. 97-102; s. 129, ch. 2004-5.</History></Section>
