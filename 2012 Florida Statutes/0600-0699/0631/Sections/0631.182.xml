Upon receipt of the report, the court shall enter an order approving the claims so reported, unless an objection is filed thereto within a deadline set by the court. The court shall direct the receiver to provide notice to each claimant of the amount recommended on the claim and the deadline for filing objections to the receiver’s report. The receiver shall resolve objections to the satisfaction of the claimant or schedule a hearing before the court on objections filed to its report, and shall provide reasonable written notice of hearing to each claimant for which a hearing is scheduled.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At the hearing, any interested person is entitled to appear. The hearing shall not be de novo but shall be limited to the record as described in s. 631.181(2). The court shall enter an order allowing, allowing in part, or disallowing the claim. Any such order is deemed to be an appealable order. In the interests of judicial economy, the court may appoint a special magistrate to resolve objections or to perform any particular service required by the court. This subsection shall apply to receivership proceedings commencing prior to, or subsequent to, July 1, 1997.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 12, 39, ch. 83-38; ss. 91, 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 12, ch. 97-262; s. 93, ch. 2004-11.</History></Section>
