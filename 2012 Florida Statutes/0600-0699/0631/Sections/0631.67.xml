The association, either on its own behalf or on behalf of such insured, may apply to have any judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding based on the default of the insolvent insurer or its failure to defend an insured set aside by the same court or administrator that made such judgment, order, decision, verdict, or finding and shall be permitted to defend against such claim on the merits. If request is made by the association, the stay of proceedings may be shortened or waived.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 18, ch. 70-20; s. 18, ch. 71-970; s. 5, ch. 77-227; s. 2, ch. 80-26; s. 809(1st), ch. 82-243; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
