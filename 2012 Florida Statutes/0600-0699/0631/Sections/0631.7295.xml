		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">With respect to covered policies for which the association becomes obligated after an entry of an order of liquidation or rehabilitation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights of the insolvent insurer arising after the order of liquidation or rehabilitation under any contract of reinsurance to which the insolvent insurer was a party, to the extent such contract provides coverage for losses occurring after the date of the order of liquidation or rehabilitation. As a condition to making such election, the association must pay all unpaid premiums due under the contract for coverage relating to periods before and after the date on which the order of liquidation or rehabilitation was entered.</Text>
