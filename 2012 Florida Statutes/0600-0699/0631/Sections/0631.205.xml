The entry of an order of conservation, rehabilitation, or liquidation shall not be deemed an anticipatory breach of any reinsurance contract, nor shall insolvency or notice of insolvency be grounds for retroactive revocation or retroactive cancellation of any reinsurance contracts by the reinsurer.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 16, 39, ch. 83-38; ss. 187, 188, ch. 91-108; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 32, ch. 2004-374.</History></Section>
