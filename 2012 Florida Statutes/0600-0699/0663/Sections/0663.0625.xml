		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An international trust company representative office may conduct any nonfiduciary activities that are ancillary to the fiduciary business of its international banking corporation or trust company, but may not act as a fiduciary. Permissible activities include advertising, marketing, and soliciting for fiduciary business on behalf of an international banking corporation or trust company; contacting existing or potential customers, answering questions, and providing information about matters related to their accounts; serving as a liaison in this state between the international banking corporation or trust company and its existing or potential customers; and engaging in any other activities approved by the office or under rules of the commission. Representatives and employees at such office may not act as a fiduciary, including, but not limited to, accepting the fiduciary appointment, executing the fiduciary documents that create the fiduciary relationship, or making discretionary decisions regarding the investment or distribution of fiduciary accounts.</Text>
