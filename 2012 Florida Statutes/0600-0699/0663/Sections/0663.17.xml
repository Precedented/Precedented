			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The office may, at its discretion, take possession of the business and property in this state of any international banking corporation that has been licensed to operate in this state upon finding that the corporation, or any of the corporation’s licensed offices operating in this state has violated any law, has neglected or refused to comply with the terms of a duly issued order of the office, is insolvent or imminently insolvent, or is transacting business in an unsound, unsafe, or unauthorized manner such that the corporation is threatened with imminent insolvency, or that the corporation is dissolved, its authority or existence is otherwise terminated or canceled in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, it is in bankruptcy, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, or similar status under the laws of any country, or it is operating under the direct control of the government or the regulatory or supervisory authority of the jurisdiction of its incorporation through government intervention or any other extraordinary actions at its domicile or elsewhere. Title to such business and property shall vest by operation of law in the office upon taking possession. Thereafter, the office shall liquidate or otherwise deal with such business and property in accordance with the provisions of this part, chapter 658, and any other provision relating to the liquidation of banking corporations. The office may deal with such business and property and prosecute and defend any and all actions relating to the liquidation. Only the claims of creditors of the international banking corporation arising out of transactions those creditors had with the international banking corporation, or any of the corporation’s licensed offices located in this state, shall be accepted by the office for payment out of the business and property which it has taken possession of in this state. Acceptance or rejection of such claims by the office shall not prejudice any creditor’s rights to otherwise share in other assets of the international banking corporation. The following claims shall not be accepted by the office for payment out of the business and property in the office’s possession in this state:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Claims which would not represent an enforceable legal obligation against an international banking corporation, or any of the corporation’s licensed offices located in this state, if such office was a separate and independent legal entity.</Text>
