		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro"> An international banking corporation that is licensed to maintain an office in this state may not continue to conduct its licensed business in this state if the international banking corporation is dissolved, or its authority or existence is otherwise terminated or canceled in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, is in bankruptcy, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, or similar status under the laws of any country, or is operating under the direct control of the government or the regulatory or supervisory authority of the jurisdiction of its incorporation through government intervention or any other extraordinary actions. A certificate of the official who is responsible for records of banking corporations of the jurisdiction of incorporation of such international banking corporation, attesting to the occurrence of any such event, or a certified copy of an order or decree of a court of such jurisdiction, directing the dissolution of such international banking corporation, the termination of its existence, or the cancellation of its authority, or declaring its status in bankruptcy, conservatorship, receivership, liquidation, or similar proceedings, or other reliable documentation that the international banking corporation is operating under the direct control of its government or a regulatory or supervisory authority, shall be delivered by the international banking corporation or its surviving officers and directors to the office. The filing of the certificate, order, documentation, or decree shall have the same effect as the revocation of the license of such international banking corporation as provided in s. 663.06.</Text>
