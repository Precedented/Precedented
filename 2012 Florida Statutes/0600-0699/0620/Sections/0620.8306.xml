A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for such an obligation solely by reason of being or so acting as a partner. This subsection applies notwithstanding anything inconsistent in the partnership agreement that existed immediately before the vote required to become a limited liability partnership under s. 620.9001(2). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, at any time during the first 6 months after the effective date of this subsection, a limited liability partnership that became a limited liability partnership before the effective date of this subsection may, by filing a notice with the Secretary of State so stating, waive its partners’ protection from liability arising from written contractual obligations of the limited liability partnership with regard to any particular written obligations or all written obligations entered into at any time or during any particular period of time set forth in the notice. If a limited liability partnership executes and delivers such a notice, each partner of the limited liability partnership is jointly and severally liable for the contractual obligations of the partnership which are the subject of the notice, except that no partner is liable under any such contract for any amount in excess of the amount for which the partner would have been liable under the laws of this state as they existed immediately before the effective date of this subsection.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 13, ch. 95-242; s. 9, ch. 99-285.</History></Section>
