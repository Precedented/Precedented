It is found and declared that the assistance herein provided for the remedying of the conditions set forth in the Housing Authorities Law constitutes a public use and purpose and an essential governmental function for which public moneys may be spent and other aid given; that it is a proper public purpose for any state public body to aid any housing authority operating within its boundaries or jurisdiction or any housing project located therein, as the state public body derives immediate benefits and advantages from such an authority or project; and that the provisions hereinafter enacted are necessary in the public interest.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 17982, 1937; CGL 1940 Supp. 7100(3-pp).</History></Section>
