The Legislature further finds that it is difficult for the public to make informed choices about dietitians and nutritionists and that the consequences of wrong choices could seriously endanger the public health and safety. The sole legislative purpose in enacting this part is to ensure that every person who practices dietetics and nutrition or nutrition counseling in this state meets minimum requirements for safe practice. It is the legislative intent that any person practicing dietetics and nutrition or nutrition counseling who falls below minimum competency or who otherwise presents a danger to the public be prohibited from practicing in this state. It is also the intent of the Legislature that the practice of nutrition counseling be authorized and regulated solely within the limits expressly provided by this part and any rules adopted pursuant thereto.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 2, 20, ch. 88-236; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 2, ch. 96-367.</History></Section>
