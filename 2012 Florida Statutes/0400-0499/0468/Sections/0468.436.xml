			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall investigate complaints and allegations of a violation of this part, chapter 455, or any rule adopted thereunder, filed against community association managers or firms and forwarded from other divisions under the Department of Business and Professional Regulation. After a complaint is received, the department shall conduct its inquiry with due regard to the interests of the affected parties. Within 30 days after receipt of a complaint, the department shall acknowledge the complaint in writing and notify the complainant whether or not the complaint is within the jurisdiction of the department and whether or not additional information is needed by the department from the complainant. The department shall conduct an investigation and shall, within 90 days after receipt of the original complaint or of a timely request for additional information, take action upon the complaint. However, the failure to complete the investigation within 90 days does not prevent the department from continuing the investigation, accepting or considering evidence obtained or received after 90 days, or taking administrative action if reasonable cause exists to believe that a violation of this part, chapter 455, or a rule of the department has occurred. If an investigation is not completed within the time limits established in this subsection, the department shall, on a monthly basis, notify the complainant in writing of the status of the investigation. When reporting its action to the complainant, the department shall inform the complainant of any right to a hearing pursuant to ss. 120.569 and 120.57.</Text>
