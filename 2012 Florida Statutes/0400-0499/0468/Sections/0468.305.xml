The certification standards shall be developed by the department to provide for educational programs for persons who are duly licensed or have a credential in a recognized health care profession or who have other training that is relevant to the program of study to be undertaken. All such categories shall include a demonstration of safety procedure competency; however, nothing in this part shall be construed to require that all operators of radiation equipment be registered radiologic technologists. An application fee of not more than $350 shall be assessed those educational programs seeking approval from the department. Application for approval shall be made on forms provided by the department. Once approved by the department, an educational program shall be assessed an annual fee not to exceed $150.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 78-383; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 6, 18, 19, ch. 84-269; s. 5, ch. 88-310; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
