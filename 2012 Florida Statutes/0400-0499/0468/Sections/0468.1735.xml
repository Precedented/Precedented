A provisional license shall be issued only to fill a position of nursing home administrator that unexpectedly becomes vacant due to illness, sudden death of the administrator, or abandonment of position and shall be issued for one single period as provided by rule not to exceed 6 months. The department shall not issue a provisional license to any applicant who is under investigation in this state or another jurisdiction for an offense which would constitute a violation of s. 468.1745 or s. 468.1755. Upon completion of the investigation, the provisions of s. 468.1755 shall apply. The provisional license may be issued to a person who does not meet all of the licensing requirements established by this part, but the board shall by rule establish minimal requirements to ensure protection of the public health, safety, and welfare. The provisional license shall be issued to the person who is designated as the responsible person next in command in the event of the administrator’s departure. The board may set an application fee not to exceed $500 for a provisional license.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 2, ch. 79-227; s. 332, ch. 81-259; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 10, 42, ch. 82-179; ss. 10, 16, 17, ch. 86-223; s. 40, ch. 89-162; s. 61, ch. 91-137; s. 10, ch. 91-156; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 193, ch. 94-119; s. 25, ch. 99-394; s. 84, ch. 2001-277.</History></Section>
