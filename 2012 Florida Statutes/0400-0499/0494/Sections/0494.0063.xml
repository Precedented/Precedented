		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">All audited financial statements required by ss. 494.001-494.0077 must be prepared by an independent licensed certified public accountant. A mortgage lender must obtain an annual financial audit report as of the date of the licensee’s fiscal year end, as disclosed to the office on the application or a subsequent amendment to the application. The mortgage lender shall submit a copy of the report to the office within 120 days after the end of the licensee’s fiscal year. If the licensee is a wholly owned subsidiary of another corporation, the financial audit report of the parent corporation satisfies this requirement. If the licensee changes its fiscal year, the licensee must file a report within 18 months after the previously submitted report. The commission may establish by rule the procedures and form for filing a financial audit report, including the requirement to file the report with the registry when technology is available.</Text>
