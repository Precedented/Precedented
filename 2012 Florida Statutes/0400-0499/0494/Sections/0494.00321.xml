				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">

				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The office may not use a credit score or the absence or insufficiency of credit history information to determine character, general fitness, or financial responsibility.</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="4">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If information contained in a credit report is used as the basis for denying a license, the office shall, in accordance with s. 120.60(3), provide with particularity the grounds or basis for denial.
