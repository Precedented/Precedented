			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A loan originator, when arranging a mortgage loan for a noninstitutional investor, shall:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Before any payment of money by the noninstitutional investor, provide an opinion of value from an appraiser stating the value of the security property unless the opinion is waived in writing. The opinion must state the value of the property as it exists on the date of the opinion. If any relationship exists between the loan originator or mortgage broker and the appraiser, that relationship shall be disclosed to the investor.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Provide to the noninstitutional investor a mortgagee’s title insurance policy or an opinion of title by an attorney licensed to practice law in the state, or a copy thereof.</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If a title insurance policy is issued, it must insure the noninstitutional investor against the unmarketability of the mortgagee’s interest in such title. It must also specify any superior liens that exist against the property. If an opinion of title is issued by an attorney, the opinion must include a statement as to the marketability of the title to the property described in the mortgage and specify the priority of the mortgage being closed.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the title insurance policy or opinion of title is not available at the time of purchase, the licensee shall provide a binder of the title insurance or conditional opinion of title. This binder or opinion must include any conditions or requirements that need to be corrected before the issuance of the final title policy or opinion of title. The binder or opinion must also include information concerning the requirements specified in subparagraph 1. Any conditions must be eliminated or waived in writing by the investor before delivery to the noninstitutional investor. The policy or opinion, or a copy thereof, shall be delivered to the investor within a reasonable period of time, not exceeding 6 months, after closing.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The requirements of this paragraph may be waived in writing. If the requirements are waived by the noninstitutional investor, the waiver must include the following statement: “The noninstitutional investor acknowledges that the mortgage broker or mortgage lender brokering this mortgage loan is not providing a title insurance policy or opinion of title issued by an attorney who is licensed to practice law in the State of Florida. Any requirement for title insurance or for a legal opinion of title is the sole responsibility of the noninstitutional mortgage investor.”</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
			</Paragraph>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each original or certified copy of the mortgage, or other instrument securing a note or assignment thereof, must be recorded before being delivered to the noninstitutional investor.

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any money from a noninstitutional investor for disbursement at a mortgage loan closing must be deposited with and disbursed by an attorney duly licensed in this state or by a title company duly licensed in this state. A person acting as a loan originator may not have control of any money from a noninstitutional investor. This subsection does not prohibit a licensee under this part from receiving a loan origination fee upon the closing of the mortgage loan funded by the noninstitutional investor.</Text>
