It recognizes that a poorly selected or fitted hearing aid not only will give little satisfaction but may interfere with hearing ability and, therefore, deems it necessary in the interest of the public health, safety, and welfare to regulate the dispensing of hearing aids in this state. Restrictions on the fitting and selling of hearing aids shall be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public from physical and economic harm, and restrictions shall not be imposed in a manner which will unreasonably affect the competitive market.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 18, ch. 83-153; ss. 1, 7, ch. 84-94; ss. 1, 19, 20, ch. 86-283; s. 22, ch. 90-341; s. 11, ch. 90-345; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
