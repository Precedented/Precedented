			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature finds that the level of early child care teacher education and training is a key predictor for determining program quality. The Legislature also finds that low wages for child care workers prevent many from obtaining increased training and education and contribute to high turnover rates. The Legislature therefore intends to help fund a program which links teacher training and education to compensation and commitment to the field of early childhood education.</Text>
