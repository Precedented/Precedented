It is the finding of the Legislature that the practice of electrology by unskilled or incompetent persons presents a danger to the public health and safety. Because it is difficult for the public to make informed choices related to electrolysis services and since the consequences of wrong choices can harm the public health and safety, it is the intent of the Legislature to prohibit the delivery of electrolysis services by persons who do not possess the necessary skills or who otherwise present a danger to the public. However, restrictions may be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public and in a manner that will not unreasonably affect the competitive market for the delivery of such services.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 92-172.</History></Section>
