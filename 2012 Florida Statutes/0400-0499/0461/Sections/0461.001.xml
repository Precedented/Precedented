The Legislature finds further that it is difficult for the public to make an informed choice about podiatric physicians and that the consequences of a wrong choice could seriously endanger their health and safety. The sole legislative purpose for enacting this chapter is to ensure that every podiatric physician practicing in this state meet minimum requirements for safe practice. It is the legislative intent that podiatric physicians who fall below minimum competency or who otherwise present a danger to the public health be prohibited from practicing in this state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 6, ch. 79-229; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 1, 12, 13, ch. 86-71; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 198, ch. 98-166.</History></Section>
