The Legislature intends that a continuum of care be established so that functionally impaired elderly persons age 60 and older may be assured the least restrictive environment suitable to their needs. The development of innovative approaches to program management, staff training, and service delivery which have an impact on cost-avoidance, cost-effectiveness, and program efficiency is encouraged.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 73-343; s. 1, ch. 76-51; s. 146, ch. 77-104; s. 18, ch. 78-433; s. 2, ch. 80-181; s. 30, ch. 95-418.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 409.3622; s. 410.022.</Text></Note></Section>
