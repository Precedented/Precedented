If the medical examiner cannot determine the law enforcement agency having jurisdiction, he or she shall notify the sheriff of the county in which the medical examiner is located, who shall determine the law enforcement agency responsible for the identification. It is the duty of the law enforcement officer assigned to and investigating the death to immediately establish the identity of the body. If the body is not immediately identified, the law enforcement agency responsible for investigating the death shall complete an Unidentified Person Report and enter the data, through the Florida Crime Information Center, into the Unidentified Person File of the National Crime Information Center. An Unidentified Person Report is that form identified by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement for use by law enforcement agencies in compiling information for entrance into the Unidentified Person File.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 86-234; s. 31, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
