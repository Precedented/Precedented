			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For purposes of privatization of public assistance overpayment recovery, the department shall enter into contracts consistent with federal law with for-profit corporations, not-for-profit corporations, or other entities capable of providing the services for recovering public assistance required under this section. The department shall issue requests for proposals, enter into a competitive bidding process, and negotiate contracts for such services. Contracts for such services may be funded on a contingency fee basis, per fiscal year, based on a percentage of the state-retained share of collections, for claims for food assistance, aid to families with dependent children, and temporary cash assistance. This section does not prohibit districts from entering into contracts to carry out the provisions of this section, if that is a cost-effective use of resources.</Text>
