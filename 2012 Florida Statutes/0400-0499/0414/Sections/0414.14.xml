		<Text xml:space="preserve">To the extent possible, the department shall align the requirements for eligibility under this chapter with the food assistance program and medical assistance eligibility policies and procedures to simplify the budgeting process and reduce errors. If the department determines that s. 414.075, relating to resources, or s. 414.085, relating to income, is inconsistent with federal law governing the food assistance program or medical assistance, and that conformance to federal law would simplify administration of the Temporary Cash Assistance Program or reduce errors without materially increasing the cost of the program to the state, the secretary of the department may propose a change in the resource or income requirements of the program by rule. </Text>
