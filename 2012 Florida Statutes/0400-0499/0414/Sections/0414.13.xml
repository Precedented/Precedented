At the time of application and redetermination of eligibility, the department shall advise applicants and participants of the availability of childhood immunizations through the county health department. Each participant who has a preschool child must verify compliance with the section. If a participant fails to provide such verification, the child for whom such verification is not provided shall be removed from consideration for purposes of calculating the assistance available to the family. If the child subject to this requirement is the only child in the family, participation in the program shall be terminated until verification of compliance is provided. The department shall waive this requirement if the failure to immunize the child is because of religious reasons or other good cause, as defined in rules adopted by the department.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 18, ch. 93-136; s. 17, ch. 96-175; s. 210, ch. 97-101; s. 5, ch. 2000-300.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 409.938.</Text></Note></Section>
