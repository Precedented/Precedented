			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Children and Family Services shall review existing waivers granted to the department by the Federal Government and determine if such waivers continue to be necessary based on the flexibility granted to states by federal law. If it is determined that termination of the waivers would reduce or eliminate potential federal cost neutrality liability, the department may take action in accordance with federal requirements. In taking such action, the department may continue research initiated in conjunction with such waivers if the department determines that continuation will provide program findings that will be useful in assessing future welfare reform alternatives.</Text>
