Recordation of any such mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument shall cause the lien thereof to attach to all after-acquired property of the mortgagor of the nature therein described as being mortgaged or pledged thereby immediately upon the acquisition of such property by the mortgagor, and such lien shall be superior to all claims of creditors of the mortgagor and purchasers of such property and to all other liens, except liens of prior record and tax liens, affecting such property.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 23, ch. 19138, 1939; CGL 1940 Supp. 6494(66).</History></Section>
