				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A child who has attained the age of 1 year but who is under the age of 5 years is eligible to enroll in the Medikids program component of the Florida Kidcare program, if the child is a member of a family that has a family income which exceeds the Medicaid applicable income level as specified in s. 409.903, but which is equal to or below 200 percent of the current federal poverty level. In determining the eligibility of such a child, an assets test is not required. A child who is eligible for Medikids may elect to enroll in Florida Healthy Kids coverage or employer-sponsored group coverage. However, a child who is eligible for Medikids may participate in the Florida Healthy Kids program only if the child has a sibling participating in the Florida Healthy Kids program and the child’s county of residence permits such enrollment.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">ENROLLMENT.<EmDash />Enrollment in the Medikids program component may occur at any time throughout the year. A child may not receive services under the Medikids program until the child is enrolled in a managed care plan or MediPass. Once determined eligible, an applicant may receive choice counseling and select a managed care plan or MediPass. The agency may initiate mandatory assignment for a Medikids applicant who has not chosen a managed care plan or MediPass provider after the applicant’s voluntary choice period ends. An applicant may select MediPass under the Medikids program component only in counties that have fewer than two managed care plans available to serve Medicaid recipients and only if the federal Health Care Financing Administration determines that MediPass constitutes “health insurance coverage” as defined in Title XXI of the Social Security Act.</Text>
