There is established a community partnership matching grant program to be operated by the Department of Children and Family Services for the purpose of encouraging local participation in community-based care for child welfare. Any children’s services council or other local government entity that makes a financial commitment to a community-based care lead agency is eligible for a grant upon proof that the children’s services council or local government entity has provided the selected lead agency at least $250,000 from any local resources otherwise available to it. The total amount of local contribution may be matched on a two-for-one basis up to a maximum amount of $2 million per council or local government entity. Awarded matching grant funds may be used for any prevention or in-home services provided by the children’s services council or other local government entity that meets temporary-assistance-for-needy-families’ eligibility requirements and can be reasonably expected to reduce the number of children entering the child welfare system. Funding available for the matching grant program is subject to legislative appropriation of nonrecurring funds provided for the purpose.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2001-232; s. 5, ch. 2002-397; s. 8, ch. 2003-146; s. 53, ch. 2005-152.</History></Section>
