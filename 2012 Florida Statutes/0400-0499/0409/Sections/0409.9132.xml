The agency shall contract with a vendor to verify the utilization and delivery of home health services and provide an electronic billing interface for home health services. The contract must require the creation of a program to submit claims electronically for the delivery of home health services. The program must verify telephonically visits for the delivery of home health services using voice biometrics. The agency may seek amendments to the Medicaid state plan and waivers of federal laws, as necessary, to implement or expand the pilot project. Notwithstanding s. 287.057(3)(f), the agency must award the contract through the competitive solicitation process and may use the current contract to expand the home health agency monitoring pilot project to include additional counties as authorized under this section.</Text>
