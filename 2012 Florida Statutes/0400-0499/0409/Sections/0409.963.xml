Subject to any limitations or directions provided in the General Appropriations Act, these payments may be made only for services included in the program, only on behalf of eligible individuals, and only to qualified providers in accordance with federal requirements for Title XIX of the Social Security Act and state law. This program of medical assistance is designated as the “Medicaid program.” The department is responsible for Medicaid eligibility determinations, including, but not limited to, policy, rules, and the agreement with the Social Security Administration for Medicaid eligibility determinations for Supplemental Security Income recipients, as well as the actual determination of eligibility. As a condition of Medicaid eligibility, subject to federal approval, the agency and the department shall ensure that each Medicaid recipient consents to the release of her or his medical records to the agency and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Department of Legal Affairs.</Text>
