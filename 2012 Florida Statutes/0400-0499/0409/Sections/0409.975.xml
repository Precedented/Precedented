			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">PROVIDER NETWORKS.<EmDash />Managed care plans must develop and maintain provider networks that meet the medical needs of their enrollees in accordance with standards established pursuant to s. 409.967(2)(c). Except as provided in this section, managed care plans may limit the providers in their networks based on credentials, quality indicators, and price.</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Plans must include all providers in the region that are classified by the agency as essential Medicaid providers, unless the agency approves, in writing, an alternative arrangement for securing the types of services offered by the essential providers. Providers are essential for serving Medicaid enrollees if they offer services that are not available from any other provider within a reasonable access standard, or if they provided a substantial share of the total units of a particular service used by Medicaid patients within the region during the last 3 years and the combined capacity of other service providers in the region is insufficient to meet the total needs of the Medicaid patients. The agency may not classify physicians and other practitioners as essential providers. The agency, at a minimum, shall determine which providers in the following categories are essential Medicaid providers:</Text>

				</SubParagraph>
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">Managed care plans that have not contracted with all essential providers in the region as of the first date of recipient enrollment, or with whom an essential provider has terminated its contract, must negotiate in good faith with such essential providers for 1 year or until an agreement is reached, whichever is first. Payments for services rendered by a nonparticipating essential provider shall be made at the applicable Medicaid rate as of the first day of the contract between the agency and the plan. A rate schedule for all essential providers shall be attached to the contract between the agency and the plan. After 1 year, managed care plans that are unable to contract with essential providers shall notify the agency and propose an alternative arrangement for securing the essential services for Medicaid enrollees. The arrangement must rely on contracts with other participating providers, regardless of whether those providers are located within the same region as the nonparticipating essential service provider. If the alternative arrangement is approved by the agency, payments to nonparticipating essential providers after the date of the agency’s approval shall equal 90 percent of the applicable Medicaid rate. If the alternative arrangement is not approved by the agency, payment to nonparticipating essential providers shall equal 110 percent of the applicable Medicaid rate.</Text>

		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Section 29, ch. 2011-135, provides that “[t]he Agency for Health Care Administration shall develop a plan for implementing a plan for medically needy Medicaid enrollees pursuant to s. 409.975(8), Florida Statutes, as created in HB 7107 or similar legislation that is adopted in the same legislative session or an extension thereof and becomes law, and shall immediately seek federal approval to implement that subsection. The plan shall include a preliminary calculation of actuarially sound rates and estimated fiscal impact.” Section 409.975(8), which appeared in early versions of HB 7107, appears as s. 409.975(7) in the enrolled version of the bill; the cross-reference was not updated to conform.</Text>
