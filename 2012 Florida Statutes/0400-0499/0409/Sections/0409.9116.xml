The disproportionate share program payments shall be limited by and conform with federal requirements. Funds shall be distributed quarterly in each fiscal year for which an appropriation is made. Notwithstanding the provisions of s. 409.915, counties are exempt from contributing toward the cost of this special reimbursement for hospitals serving a disproportionate share of low-income patients.</Text><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The following formula shall be used by the agency to calculate the total amount earned for hospitals that participate in the rural hospital disproportionate share program or the financial assistance program:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">TAERH = (CCD + MDD)/TPD</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Flush" SpaceAbove="true">Where:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">CCD = total charity care-other, plus charity care-Hill-Burton, minus 50 percent of unrestricted tax revenue from local governments, and restricted funds for indigent care, divided by gross revenue per adjusted patient day; however, if CCD is less than zero, then zero shall be used for CCD.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">MDD = Medicaid inpatient days plus Medicaid HMO inpatient days.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">TPD = total inpatient days.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">TAERH = total amount earned by each rural hospital.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Flush" SpaceAbove="true">In computing the total amount earned by each rural hospital, the agency must use the average of the 3 most recent years of actual data reported in accordance with s. 408.061(4).
