			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">ELIGIBLE PLANS.<EmDash />Services in the Medicaid managed care program shall be provided by eligible plans. A provider service network must be capable of providing all covered services to a mandatory Medicaid managed care enrollee or may limit the provision of services to a specific target population based on the age, chronic disease state, or medical condition of the enrollee to whom the network will provide services. A specialty provider service network must be capable of coordinating care and delivering or arranging for the delivery of all covered services to the target population. A provider service network may partner with an insurer licensed under chapter 627 or a health maintenance organization licensed under chapter 641 to meet the requirements of a Medicaid contract.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An eligible plan must disclose any business relationship it has with any other eligible plan that responds to the invitation to negotiate. The agency may not select plans in the same region for the same managed care program that have a business relationship with each other. Failure to disclose any business relationship shall result in disqualification from participation in any region for the first full contract period after the discovery of the business relationship by the agency. For the purpose of this section, “business relationship” means an ownership or controlling interest, an affiliate or subsidiary relationship, a common parent, or any mutual interest in any limited partnership, limited liability partnership, limited liability company, or other entity or business association, including all wholly or partially owned subsidiaries, majority-owned subsidiaries, parent companies, or affiliates of such entities, business associations, or other enterprises, that exists for the purpose of making a profit.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">After negotiations are conducted, the agency shall select the eligible plans that are determined to be responsive and provide the best value to the state. Preference shall be given to plans that:</Text>

The second highest number of points shall be awarded to a plan that has a majority of its operational functions performed in the state. The agency may establish a third tier; however, preference points may not be awarded to plans that perform only community outreach, medical director functions, and state administrative functions in the state. For purposes of this subparagraph, operational functions include corporate headquarters, claims processing, member services, provider relations, utilization and prior authorization, case management, disease and quality functions, and finance and administration. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term “corporate headquarters” means the principal office of the organization, which may not be a subsidiary, directly or indirectly through one or more subsidiaries of, or a joint venture with, any other entity whose principal office is not located in the state.</Text>

					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For prepaid plans, determination of the amount of savings shall be calculated by comparison to the Medicaid rates that the agency paid managed care plans for similar populations in the same areas in the prior year. In regions containing no prepaid plans in the prior year, determination of the amount of savings shall be calculated by comparison to the Medicaid rates established and certified for those regions in the prior year.</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For provider service networks operating on a fee-for-service basis, determination of the amount of savings shall be calculated by comparison to the Medicaid rates that the agency paid on a fee-for-service basis for the same services in the prior year.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">ADMINISTRATIVE CHALLENGE.<EmDash />Any eligible plan that participates in an invitation to negotiate in more than one region and is selected in at least one region may not begin serving Medicaid recipients in any region for which it was selected until all administrative challenges to procurements required by this section to which the eligible plan is a party have been finalized. If the number of plans selected is less than the maximum amount of plans permitted in the region, the agency may contract with other selected plans in the region not participating in the administrative challenge before resolution of the administrative challenge. For purposes of this subsection, an administrative challenge is finalized if an order granting voluntary dismissal with prejudice has been entered by any court established under Article V of the State Constitution or by the Division of Administrative Hearings, a final order has been entered into by the agency and the deadline for appeal has expired, a final order has been entered by the First District Court of Appeal and the time to seek any available review by the Florida Supreme Court has expired, or a final order has been entered by the Florida Supreme Court and a warrant has been issued.</Text>
