		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Children and Family Services may serve dependent children deemed to be in need of family-centered, cognitive-behavioral interventions designed to mitigate out-of-home placements. Treatment services may be evidenced-based with family therapy and group therapy components for youth for whom these services are appropriate. Dependent youth at risk of out-of-home placement or currently within the foster care system are eligible for these family therapy and group therapy services. The services shall be provided as an alternative to specialized therapeutic foster or group care. A child who has been adjudicated delinquent, had adjudication withheld, or committed any violent crime, except for females adjudicated delinquent for domestic violence, any first-degree felony, or any felony direct-filed in adult court, may not be served by the program. The department and each participating dependency court may jointly develop eligibility criteria to identify youth appropriate for services in this program.</Text>
