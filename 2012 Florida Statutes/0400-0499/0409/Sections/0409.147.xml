These children experience below-average performance on standardized tests and graduate from high school in fewer numbers. Most of these children are eligible for the free or reduced-price school lunch program.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Children in these neighborhoods often suffer from high rates of asthma, a higher risk of lead poisoning, and inadequate health care, and they are routinely exposed to violence and crime.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In spite of these obstacles, these neighborhoods are many times home to strong individuals and institutions that are committed to making a difference in the lives of children and their families.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">It is therefore the intent of the Legislature to assist disadvantaged areas within the state in creating a community-based service network that develops, coordinates, and provides quality education, accessible health care, youth development programs, opportunities for employment, and safe and affordable housing for children and families living within its boundaries.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">POLICY AND PURPOSE.<EmDash />It is the policy of this state to provide the necessary means to assist local communities, the children and families who live in those communities, and the private sector in creating a sound educational, social, and economic environment. To achieve this objective, the state intends to provide investments sufficient to encourage community partners to commit financial and other resources to severely disadvantaged areas. The purpose of this section is to establish a process that clearly identifies the severely disadvantaged areas and provides guidance for developing a new social service paradigm that systematically coordinates programs that address the critical needs of children and their families and for directing efforts to rebuild the basic infrastructure of the community. The Legislature, therefore, declares the creation of children’s initiatives, through the collaborative efforts of government and the private sector, to be a public purpose.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">DEFINITIONS.<EmDash />As used in this section, the term:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Governing body” means the commission or other legislative body charged with governing a county or municipality.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Ounce” means the Ounce of Prevention Fund of Florida, Inc.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Planning team” means a children’s initiative planning team established under this section.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Resident” means a person who lives or operates a small community-based business or organization within the boundaries of the children’s initiative.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">CHILDREN’S INITIATIVE NOMINATING PROCESS.<EmDash />A county or municipality, or a county and one or more municipalities together, may apply to the Ounce to designate an area as a children’s initiative after the governing body:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Adopts a resolution that:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Finds that an area exists in such county or municipality, or in the county and one or more municipalities, that chronically exhibits extreme and unacceptable levels of poverty, unemployment, physical deterioration, as well as limited access to quality educational, health care, and social services.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Determines that the rehabilitation, conservation, or redevelopment, or a combination thereof, of the area is necessary in the interest of improving the health, wellness, education, living conditions, and livelihoods of the children and families who live in the county or municipality.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Determines that the revitalization of the area can occur only if the state and the private sector invest resources to improve infrastructure and the provision of services.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Establishes a children’s initiative planning team as provided in subsection (5).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Develops and adopts a strategic community plan as provided in subsection (6).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Creates a corporation not for profit as provided in subsection (7).</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">CHILDREN’S INITIATIVE PLANNING TEAM.<EmDash /></Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">After the governing body adopts the resolution described in subsection (4), the county or municipality shall establish a children’s initiative planning team.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The planning team shall include residents and representatives from community-based organizations and other community institutions.
