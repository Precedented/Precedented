The transportation improvement program shall also identify transportation improvements that will be advanced with such funds during the program period. Funds required by this subsection to be included in the transportation improvement program shall only be included after consultation with all affected agencies and shall only be expended if such funds are included in the transportation improvement program.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each metropolitan planning organization or designated official planning agency shall recommend to the commission a single community transportation coordinator. However, a purchasing agency may not serve as the community transportation coordinator in any designated service area. The coordinator may provide all or a portion of needed transportation services for the transportation disadvantaged but shall be responsible for the provision of those coordinated services. Based on approved commission evaluation criteria, the coordinator shall subcontract or broker those services that are more cost-effectively and efficiently provided by subcontracting or brokering. The performance of the coordinator shall be evaluated based on the commission’s approved evaluation criteria by the coordinating board at least annually. A copy of the evaluation shall be submitted to the metropolitan planning organization or the designated official planning agency, and the commission. The recommendation or termination of any community transportation coordinator shall be subject to approval by the commission.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each metropolitan planning organization or designated official planning agency shall request each local government in its jurisdiction to provide the actual expenditures of all local and direct federal funds to be expended for transportation for the disadvantaged. The metropolitan planning organization or designated official planning agency shall consolidate this information into a single report and forward it, by September 15, to the commission.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 6, 9, ch. 79-180; ss. 1, 3, ch. 84-56; ss. 5, 14, ch. 89-376; s. 5, ch. 91-429; s. 67, ch. 94-237; s. 27, ch. 2000-266; s. 6, ch. 2008-203.</History></Section>
