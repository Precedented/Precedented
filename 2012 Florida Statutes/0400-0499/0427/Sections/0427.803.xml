The duration of the express warranty must be at least 1 year after first delivery of the assistive technology device to the consumer. In the absence of an express warranty from the manufacturer, the manufacturer is considered to have expressly warranted to the consumer of an assistive technology device that, for a period of 1 year after the date of first delivery to the consumer, the assistive technology device will be free from any condition or defect that substantially impairs the value of the assistive technology device to the consumer.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 97-47; s. 18, ch. 99-307; s. 4, ch. 2001-214.</History></Section>
