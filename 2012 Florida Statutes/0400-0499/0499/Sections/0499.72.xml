			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If any person violates any provision of this part or any rule adopted pursuant thereto, or violates a cease and desist order issued by the department, the department may impose an administrative fine, not to exceed $5,000 for each violation per day, or may suspend or revoke the license or permit issued to such person, or both.

The department shall allow the licensee or permittee a reasonable period, not to exceed 30 days, within which to pay to the department the amount of the fine so imposed. If the licensee or permittee fails to pay the fine in its entirety to the department at its office in Tallahassee within the period so allowed, the licenses or permits of such person shall stand revoked upon expiration of such period.</Text>
