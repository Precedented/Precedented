			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding s. 287.057(3)(f)12., whenever the department intends to contract with a public postsecondary institution to provide a service, the department must allow all public postsecondary institutions in this state that are accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to bid on the contract. Thereafter, notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, if a public postsecondary institution intends to subcontract for any service awarded in the contract, the subcontracted service must be procured by competitive procedures.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When it is in the best interest of a defined segment of its consumer population, the department may competitively procure and contract for systems of treatment or service that involve multiple providers, rather than procuring and contracting for treatment or services separately from each participating provider. The department must ensure that all providers that participate in the treatment or service system meet all applicable statutory, regulatory, service quality, and cost control requirements. If other governmental entities or units of special purpose government contribute matching funds to the support of a given system of treatment or service, the department shall formally request information from those funding entities in the procurement process and may take the information received into account in the selection process. If a local government contributes matching funds to support the system of treatment or contracted service and if the match constitutes at least 25 percent of the value of the contract, the department shall afford the governmental match contributor an opportunity to name an employee as one of the persons required by s. 287.057(16) to evaluate or negotiate certain contracts, unless the department sets forth in writing the reason why the inclusion would be contrary to the best interest of the state. Any employee so named by the governmental match contributor shall qualify as one of the persons required by s. 287.057(16). A governmental entity or unit of special purpose government may not name an employee as one of the persons required by s. 287.057(16) if it, or any of its political subdivisions, executive agencies, or special districts, intends to compete for the contract to be awarded. The governmental funding entity or contributor of matching funds must comply with all procurement procedures set forth in s. 287.057 when appropriate and required.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">CONTRACT MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS AND PROCESS.<EmDash />The Department of Children and Family Services shall review the time period for which the department executes contracts and shall execute multiyear contracts to make the most efficient use of the resources devoted to contract processing and execution. Whenever the department chooses not to use a multiyear contract, a justification for that decision must be contained in the contract. Notwithstanding s. 287.057(14), the department is responsible for establishing a contract management process that requires a member of the department’s Senior Management or Selected Exempt Service to assign in writing the responsibility of a contract to a contract manager. The department shall maintain a set of procedures describing its contract management process which must minimally include the following requirements:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The contract manager shall maintain the official contract file throughout the duration of the contract and for a period not less than 6 years after the termination of the contract.</Text>

			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="f">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The contract manager shall periodically document any differences between the required performance measures and the actual performance measures. If a contractor fails to meet and comply with the performance measures established in the contract, the department may allow a reasonable period for the contractor to correct performance deficiencies. If performance deficiencies are not resolved to the satisfaction of the department within the prescribed time, and if no extenuating circumstances can be documented by the contractor to the department’s satisfaction, the department must terminate the contract. The department may not enter into a new contract with that same contractor for the services for which the contract was previously terminated for a period of at least 24 months after the date of termination. The contract manager shall obtain and enforce corrective action plans, if appropriate, and maintain records regarding the completion or failure to complete corrective action items.</Text>
