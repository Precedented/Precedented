The requirement that a parent or legal guardian work a shift of 24 hours or more must be certified in writing by the employer, and the written certification shall be maintained in the facility by the child care provider and made available to the licensing agency. The time that a child remains in child care, however, may not exceed 72 consecutive hours in any 7-day period. During a declared state of emergency, the child care licensing agency may temporarily waive the time limitations provided in this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 2006-91.</History></Section>
