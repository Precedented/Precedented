To this end, violations of the provisions of s. 447.501 shall be remedied by the commission in accordance with the following procedures and in accordance with chapter 120; however, to the extent that chapter 120 is inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the procedures contained in this section shall govern:</Text><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A proceeding to remedy a violation of the provisions of s. 447.501 shall be initiated by the filing of a charge with the commission by an employer, employee, or employee organization, or any combination thereof. Such a charge shall contain a clear and concise statement of facts constituting the alleged unfair labor practice, including the names of all individuals involved in the alleged unfair labor practice, specific reference to the provisions of s. 447.501 alleged to have been violated, and such other relevant information as the commission may by rule require or allow. Service of the charge shall be made upon each named respondent at the time of filing with the commission. The charge must be accompanied by sworn statements and documentary evidence sufficient to establish a prima facie violation of the applicable unfair labor practice provision. Such supporting evidence is not to be attached to the charge and is to be furnished only to the commission.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The commission, or any agent designated by it for such purpose, shall thereupon review the charge to determine its sufficiency.</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If upon review it is determined that the charge is insufficient, the commission or its designated agent may issue a summary dismissal of the charge. A charging party whose charge is dismissed by a designated agent may appeal the dismissal to the commission within 20 days after the date of issuance of the dismissal. If the commission finds the charge to be sufficient, it shall reinstate the charge.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If upon review it is determined that the charge is sufficient, the commission shall notify the parties.

The commission may also, in its discretion, allow other interested parties to intervene in the proceeding.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Whenever a charging party alleges that a respondent has engaged in unfair labor practices and that the charging party will suffer substantial and irreparable injury if not granted temporary relief, the commission may petition the circuit court for appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication by the commission with respect to such matter. Upon the filing of any such petition, the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon the parties and, thereupon, shall have jurisdiction to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The commission may issue prehearing orders requiring the parties to provide written statements of relevant issues of fact and law and such other information as the commission may require to expedite the resolution of the case. Such orders may further direct the parties to identify witnesses, exchange intended exhibits and documentary evidence, and appear at a conference before the commission or a member thereof, or a designated hearing officer, for the purpose of handling such matters as will aid the commission in expeditiously resolving the case before it.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Whenever the proceeding involves a disputed issue of material fact and an evidentiary hearing is to be conducted:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The commission shall issue and serve upon all parties a notice of hearing before an assigned hearing officer at a time and place specified therein.

The recommended order may also include recommended conclusions of law if requested by the commission.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the hearing was held before the commission or a member of the commission, the commission may elect to issue a final order which is in compliance with ss. 120.569 and 120.57.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If, upon consideration of the record in the case, the commission finds that an unfair labor practice has been committed, it shall issue and cause to be served an order requiring the appropriate party or parties to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice and take such positive action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will best implement the general policies expressed in this part. However, no order of the commission shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment of any back pay, if the individual was suspended or discharged for cause. The order may further require the party or parties to make periodic reports showing the extent to which it has complied with the order.
