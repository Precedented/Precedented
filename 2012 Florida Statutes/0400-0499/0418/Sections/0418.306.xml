The bonds shall bear interest, payable semiannually, at a rate fixed in the resolution, subject to s. 215.84, and may be in one or more series; may bear such date or dates; may mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates; may be made payable in such medium of payment, at such place, within or without the state; may carry such registration privileges; may be subject to such terms of redemption, with or without premium; may be executed in such manner; may contain such terms, covenants, and conditions; and may be in such form, either coupon or registered, as provided in such resolution or a subsequent resolution. The bonds may be sold all at one time or in blocks from time to time, at public or private sale, or, if they are refunding bonds, may also be delivered and exchanged for the outstanding obligations to be refunded thereby, in such manner as the trustees determine by resolution, and at such price or prices computed according to standard tables of bond value as will yield to the purchasers or the holders of the obligations surrendered in exchange, in the case of refunding bonds, income at a rate pursuant to s. 215.84 to the maturity dates of the several bonds so sold or exchanged on the money paid or the principal amount of obligations surrendered therefor to the district. Pending the preparation of the definitive bonds, interim certificates or receipts or temporary bonds in such form and with such provisions as the trustees determine may be issued to the purchaser or purchasers of the bonds. The bonds, and such interim certificates or receipts or temporary bonds, shall be fully negotiable.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 37, ch. 83-204.</History></Section>
