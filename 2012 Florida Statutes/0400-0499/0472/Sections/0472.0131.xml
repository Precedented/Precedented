			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall ensure that examinations adequately and reliably measure an applicant’s ability to practice the profession of surveying and mapping. After an examination developed or approved by the department has been administered, the board or department may reject any question that does not reliably measure the general areas of competency specified in the rules of the board. The department shall use professional testing services for the development, preparation, and evaluation of examinations when such services are available and approved by the board.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The board may approve by rule the use of any national examination which the department has certified as meeting requirements of national examinations and generally accepted testing standards under department rules. Providers of examinations, which may be profit or nonprofit entities, seeking certification by the department shall pay the actual costs incurred by the department in making a determination regarding the certification of the vendor. The department shall use any national examination that is available, certified by the department, and approved by the board. The name and number of a candidate may be provided to a national contractor for the limited purpose of preparing the grade tape and information to be returned to the board or department or, to the extent otherwise specified by rule, the candidate may apply directly to the vendor of the national examination. The department may delegate to the board the duty to provide and administer the examination. Any national examination approved by the board prior to October 1, 1997, is deemed certified under this paragraph. Any licensing or certification examination that is not developed or administered by the department in-house or provided as a national examination shall be competitively bid.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the board concurs, the department may, for a fee, share with any other state’s licensing authority an examination developed by or for the department unless prohibited by a contract entered into by the department for development or purchase of the examination. The department, with the concurrence of the board, shall establish guidelines that ensure security of a shared exam and shall require that any other state’s licensing authority comply with those guidelines.

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For each examination developed by the department or a contracted vendor, the board shall make rules providing for reexamination of any applicant who failed an examination.
