The Legislature intends through ss. 410.601-410.606 to provide for the development, expansion, and coordination of community-based services for disabled adults, but not to supplant existing programs. The Legislature further intends to establish a continuum of services so that disabled adults may be assured the least restrictive environment suitable to their needs. In addition, the Legislature intends that the Department of Children and Family Services encourage innovative and efficient approaches to program management, staff training, and service delivery.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 88-350; s. 125, ch. 97-101.</History></Section>
