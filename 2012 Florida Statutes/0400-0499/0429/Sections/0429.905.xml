Such a facility need not be licensed as an adult day care center; however, the agency must monitor the facility during the regular inspection and at least biennially to ensure adequate space and sufficient staff. If an assisted living facility, a hospital, or a nursing home holds itself out to the public as an adult day care center, it must be licensed as such and meet all standards prescribed by statute and rule. For the purpose of this subsection, the term “day” means any portion of a 24-hour day.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 78-336; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 79, 83, ch. 83-181; s. 6, ch. 88-235; ss. 4, 17, ch. 93-215; s. 20, ch. 95-210; s. 4, ch. 2006-197; s. 30, ch. 2012-160.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 400.553.</Text></Note></Section>
