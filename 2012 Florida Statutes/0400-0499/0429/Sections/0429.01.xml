To the maximum extent possible, appropriate community-based programs must be available to state-supported residents to augment the services provided in assisted living facilities. The Legislature recognizes that assisted living facilities are an important part of the continuum of long-term care in the state. In support of the goal of aging in place, the Legislature further recognizes that assisted living facilities should be operated and regulated as residential environments with supportive services and not as medical or nursing facilities. The services available in these facilities, either directly or through contract or agreement, are intended to help residents remain as independent as possible. Regulations governing these facilities must be sufficiently flexible to allow facilities to adopt policies that enable residents to age in place when resources are available to meet their needs and accommodate their preferences.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The principle that a license issued under this part is a public trust and a privilege and is not an entitlement should guide the finder of fact or trier of law at any administrative proceeding or in a court action initiated by the Agency for Health Care Administration to enforce this part.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 2, ch. 75-233; ss. 12, 13, ch. 80-198; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 79, 83, ch. 83-181; s. 2, ch. 87-371; s. 2, ch. 91-263; s. 28, ch. 92-33; ss. 1, 38, 39, ch. 93-216; s. 6, ch. 95-210; s. 46, ch. 95-418; s. 122, ch. 99-8; s. 2, ch. 2006-197.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 400.401.</Text></Note></Section>
