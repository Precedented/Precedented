It shall be necessary to maintain and register a branch office whenever, in the judgment of the commission, the business conducted at a place other than the principal office is of such a nature that the public interest requires registration of the branch office. Any office shall be deemed to be a branch office if the name or advertising of a broker having a principal office located elsewhere is displayed in such a manner as to reasonably lead the public to believe that such office is owned or operated by such broker.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 25, ch. 12223, 1927; CGL 4086; s. 3, ch. 74-181; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-457; s. 8, ch. 78-366; ss. 18, 42, 43, ch. 79-239; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 20, 38, ch. 82-1; ss. 28, 30, ch. 88-20; s. 51, ch. 89-162; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 372, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
