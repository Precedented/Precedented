The primary supervisory appraiser may also designate additional licensed or certified appraisers as secondary supervisory appraisers. A secondary supervisory appraiser must be affiliated with the same firm or business as the primary supervisory appraiser and the primary or secondary supervisory appraiser must have the same business address as the registered trainee real estate appraiser. The primary supervisory appraiser must notify the Division of Real Estate of the name and address of any primary and secondary supervisory appraiser for whom the registered trainee will perform appraisal services, and must also notify the division within 10 days after terminating such relationship. Termination of the relationship with a primary supervisory appraiser automatically terminates the relationship with the secondary supervisory appraiser.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A registered trainee real estate appraiser may only receive compensation through or from the primary supervisory appraiser.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A supervisory appraiser may not be employed by a trainee or by a corporation, partnership, firm, or group in which the trainee has a controlling interest.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 2001-274; s. 14, ch. 2003-164; s. 81, ch. 2004-5; s. 7, ch. 2006-198.</History></Section>
