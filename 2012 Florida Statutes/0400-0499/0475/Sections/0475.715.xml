The closing agent shall compute the owner’s net proceeds by subtracting from the gross sales proceeds the amount required to discharge any such prior recorded lien and the amount of money secured by any such prior recorded lien that the buyer permits to remain a lien against the title to the commercial real estate. A prior recorded lien includes, without limitation, a valid construction lien claim that is recorded after the recording of the broker’s commission notice but which relates back to a notice of commencement recorded under s. 713.13 prior to the recording date of the broker’s commission notice.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2005-275; s. 14, ch. 2006-210.</History></Section>
