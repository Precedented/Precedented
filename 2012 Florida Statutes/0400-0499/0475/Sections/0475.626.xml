			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A person who violates any provision of subsection (1) commits a misdemeanor of the second degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083, except when a different punishment is prescribed by this section. This section does not prohibit the prosecution under any other criminal statute of this state of any person for an act or conduct prohibited by this section; however, in such cases, the state may prosecute under this section or under such other statute, or may charge both offenses in one prosecution, but the sentence imposed shall not be a greater fine or longer sentence than that prescribed for the offense which carries the more severe penalties. A civil case, a criminal case, or a denial, revocation, or suspension proceeding may arise out of the same alleged state of facts, and the pendency or result of one such case or proceeding shall not stay or control the result of either of the others.</Text>
