The central monitoring station must employ call-verification methods for the premises generating the alarm signal if the first call is not answered. However, if the intrusion/burglary alarms have properly operating visual or auditory sensors that enable the monitoring personnel to verify the alarm signal, verification calling is not required.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 17, ch. 96-298; s. 3, ch. 97-122; s. 6, ch. 2006-154.</History></Section>
