Such person shall notify the board, within 30 days after the death of the contractor, of his or her name and address, knowledge of the contract, and ability to complete it. If the board approves, he or she may proceed with the contract. For purposes of this section, an incomplete contract is one which has been awarded to, or entered into by, the contractor before his or her death, or on which he or she was the low bidder and the contract is subsequently awarded to him or her, regardless of whether any actual work has commenced under the contract before the contractor’s death.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 10, 17, ch. 79-200; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 12, 20, 21, ch. 88-156; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 485, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
