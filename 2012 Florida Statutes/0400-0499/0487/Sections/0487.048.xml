Application for the license shall be made on a form prescribed by the department. The license must be obtained before entering into business or transferring ownership of a business. The department may require examination or other proof of competency of individuals to whom licenses are issued or of individuals employed by persons to whom licenses are issued. Demonstration of continued competency may be required for license renewal, as set by rule. The license shall be renewed annually as provided by rule. An annual license fee not exceeding $250 shall be established by rule. However, a user of a restricted-use pesticide may distribute unopened containers of a properly labeled pesticide to another user who is legally entitled to use that restricted-use pesticide without obtaining a pesticide dealer’s license. The exclusive purpose of distribution of the restricted-use pesticide is to keep it from becoming a hazardous waste as defined in s. 403.703(13).</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A record of each sale of a restricted-use pesticide shall be maintained by the licensed dealer for a period of 2 years and shall be made available to the department upon request. The content of the record shall be established by department rule.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 14, 37, ch. 92-115; s. 18, ch. 2000-154; s. 129, ch. 2008-4.</History></Section>
