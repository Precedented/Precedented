If the application for renewal of any license provided for in this part is not filed on time, a late fee shall be assessed not to exceed $50. However, the penalty shall not apply if the renewal application is filed within 60 days after the renewal date, provided the applicant furnishes an affidavit certifying that he or she has not engaged in business subsequent to the expiration of the license for a period not exceeding 60 days. A license may be renewed without taking another examination unless the department determines that new knowledge related to the classification for which the applicant has applied makes a new examination necessary; however, the department may require the applicant to provide evidence of continued competency, as determined by rule. If the license is not renewed within 60 days after the expiration date, then the licensee may again be required to take another examination, unless there is some unavoidable circumstance which results in the delay of the renewal of any license issued under this part which was not under the applicant’s control.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall require all certified applicators to provide evidence of continued competency through the implementation of a recertification program set forth by rule. Recertification options shall include at least one of the following: the attendance of training sessions with either a written or oral examination; or accumulation of a minimum number of recertification credits through attendance of approved continuing education classes or seminars. If the licensee fails to renew the license within 60 days of the expiration date, reexamination shall be required.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 74-247; s. 12, ch. 79-210; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 7, 14, 15, ch. 82-167; s. 1, ch. 86-72; ss. 15, 37, ch. 92-115; s. 12, ch. 94-233; s. 476, ch. 97-103; s. 19, ch. 2000-154; s. 31, ch. 2004-64.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 487.157.</Text></Note></Section>
