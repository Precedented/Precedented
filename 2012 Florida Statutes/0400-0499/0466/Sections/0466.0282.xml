In order to be recognized by the board as a bona fide accrediting organization for a specific area of dental practice other than a specialty area of dentistry authorized under subsection (1), the organization must condition membership or credentialing of its members upon all of the following:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Successful completion of a formal, full-time advanced education program that is affiliated with or sponsored by a university-based dental school and is:</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Beyond the dental degree;</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">At the graduate or postgraduate level; and</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Of at least 12 months in duration.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Prior didactic training and clinical experience in the specific area of dentistry which is greater than that of other dentists.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Successful completion of oral and written examinations based on psychometric principles.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (1) and (2), a dentist who lacks membership in or certification, diplomate status, or other similar credentials from an accrediting organization approved as bona fide by either the American Dental Association or the board may announce a practice emphasis in any other area of dental practice if the dentist incorporates in capital letters or some other manner clearly distinguishable from the rest of the announcement, solicitation, or advertisement the following statement: “<Directions xml:space="preserve">(NAME OF ANNOUNCED AREA OF DENTAL PRACTICE)</Directions> IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A SPECIALTY AREA BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OR THE FLORIDA BOARD OF DENTISTRY.” If such an area of dental practice is officially recognized by an organization which the dentist desires to acknowledge or otherwise reference in the dentist’s announcement, solicitation, or advertisement, the same announcement, solicitation, or advertisement shall also state prominently: “<Directions xml:space="preserve">(NAME OF REFERENCED ORGANIZATION)</Directions> IS NOT RECOGNIZED AS A BONA FIDE SPECIALTY ACCREDITING ORGANIZATION BY THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION OR THE FLORIDA BOARD OF DENTISTRY.”</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The purpose of this section is to prevent a dentist from advertising without appropriate disclosure membership in an organization which may be perceived by the public as recognizing or accrediting specialization or other unique competencies in an area of dentistry that is not recognized or accredited by the American Dental Association or the board in accordance with this section. The purpose of this section is also to prohibit a dentist from advertising a specialty or other area of dental practice without appropriate disclosure unless the special competencies held by the dentist satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) or subsection (2). The Legislature finds that dental consumers can reasonably rely on these requirements as satisfactory evidence of a dentist’s attainment of meaningful competencies in the specialty or other bona fide area of dental practice advertised. The Legislature also finds that this process for the recognition of dental specialties and other bona fide areas of dental practice is the least restrictive means available to ensure that consumers are not misled about a dentist’s unique credentials.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 94-105; s. 6, ch. 96-281; s. 1111, ch. 97-103; s. 3, ch. 99-183.</History></Section>
