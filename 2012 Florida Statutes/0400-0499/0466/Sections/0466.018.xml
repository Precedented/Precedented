<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0466.018" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Dentist of record; patient records.</Catchline><SectionBody><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each patient shall have a dentist of record. The dentist of record shall remain primarily responsible for all dental treatment on such patient regardless of whether the treatment is rendered by the dentist or by another dentist, dental hygienist, or dental assistant rendering such treatment in conjunction with, at the direction or request of, or under the supervision of such dentist of record. The dentist of record shall be identified in the record of the patient. If treatment is rendered by a dentist other than the dentist of record or by a dental hygienist or assistant, the name or initials of such person shall be placed in the record of the patient. In any disciplinary proceeding brought pursuant to this chapter or chapter 456, it shall be presumed as a matter of law that treatment was rendered by the dentist of record unless otherwise noted on the patient record pursuant to this section. The dentist of record and any other treating dentist are subject to discipline pursuant to this chapter or chapter 456 for treatment rendered the patient and performed in violation of such chapter. One of the purposes of this section is to ensure that the responsibility for each patient is assigned to one dentist in a multidentist practice of any nature and to assign primary responsibility to the dentist for treatment rendered by a dental hygienist or assistant under her or his supervision. This section shall not be construed to assign any responsibility to a dentist of record for treatment rendered pursuant to a proper referral to another dentist not in practice with the dentist of record or to prohibit a patient from voluntarily selecting a new dentist without permission of the dentist of record.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the dentist of record is not identified in the patient record as required by subsection (1), it shall be presumed as a matter of law that the dentist of record is the owner of the dental practice in which the patient was treated. Further, the dentist of record in a multidentist practice shall not change unless the subsequent treating dentist acknowledges in writing in the record that she or he is now the dentist of record for the patient. It shall be presumed as a matter of law that a new dentist of record has taken or reviewed the patient’s medical history and dental records, that she or he has examined the patient, and that she or he has either developed a new treatment plan or has agreed to continue the preexisting treatment plan. However, the dentist of record shall be changed when the dentist of record leaves the practice where the treatment was being rendered and the patient elects to continue treatment in the office where treatment began.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Every dentist shall maintain written dental records and medical history records which justify the course of treatment of the patient. The records shall include, but not be limited to, patient history, examination results, test results, and, if taken, X rays.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In a multidentist practice of any nature, the owner dentist shall maintain either the original or a duplicate of all patient records, including dental charts, patient histories, examination and test results, study models, and X rays, of any patient treated by a dentist at the owner dentist’s practice facility. The purpose of this requirement is to impose a duty upon the owner of a multidentist practice to maintain patient records for all patients treated at the owner’s practice facility whether or not the owner was involved in the patient’s treatment. This subsection does not relieve the dentist of record in a multidentist practice of the responsibility to maintain patient records. An owner dentist of a multidentist practice may be relieved of the responsibility to maintain the original or duplicate patient records for patients treated at the owner dentist’s practice facility if, upon request of the patient or the patient’s legal representative, she or he transfers custody of the records to another dentist, the patient, or the patient’s legal representative and retains, in lieu of the records, a written statement, signed by the owner dentist, the person who received the records, and two witnesses, that lists the date, the records that were transferred, and the persons to whom the records were transferred. Further, the dentist of record may be relieved of the responsibility to maintain the original or duplicate patient records if she or he leaves the practice where the treatment was rendered, transfers custody of the records to the owner of the practice, and retains, in lieu of the records, a written statement, signed by the dentist of record, the owner of the practice, and two witnesses, that lists the date and the records that were transferred. The owner dentist shall provide reasonable access to duplicate records at cost.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">All patient records kept in accordance with this section shall be maintained for a period of 4 years from the date of the patient’s last appointment.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 3, ch. 79-330; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 3, 41, ch. 82-179; ss. 11, 23, 24, ch. 86-291; s. 60, ch. 91-137; s. 7, ch. 91-156; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 257, ch. 97-103; s. 71, ch. 98-166; s. 130, ch. 2000-160.</History></Section>
