The Legislature finds that access to prenatal care and delivery services is limited by the inadequate number of providers of such services and that the regulated practice of midwifery may help to reduce this shortage. The Legislature also recognizes the need for the safe and effective delivery of newborn babies and the health, safety, and welfare of their mothers in the delivery process. The Legislature finds that the interests of public health require the regulation of the practice of midwifery in this state for the purpose of protecting the health and welfare of mothers and infants. Therefore, it is unlawful for any person to practice midwifery in this state unless such person is licensed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or s. 464.012.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 3, ch. 82-99; ss. 1, 8, ch. 84-268; ss. 4, 5, ch. 91-429; ss. 1, 19, ch. 92-179; s. 79, ch. 2001-62.</History></Section>
