The Legislature finds further that it is difficult for the public to make an informed choice when selecting an osteopathic physician and that the consequences of a wrong decision could seriously harm the public health and safety. The primary legislative purpose in enacting this chapter is to ensure that every osteopathic physician practicing in this state meets minimum requirements for safe and effective practice. It is the legislative intent that osteopathic physicians who fall below minimum competency or who otherwise present a danger to the public shall be prohibited from practicing in this state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 6, ch. 79-230; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 1, 27, 29, ch. 86-290; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
