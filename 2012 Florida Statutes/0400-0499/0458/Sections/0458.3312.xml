However, a physician may indicate the services offered and may state that his or her practice is limited to one or more types of services when this accurately reflects the scope of practice of the physician. A physician may not hold himself or herself out as a board-certified specialist in dermatology unless the recognizing agency, whether authorized in statute or by rule, is triennially reviewed and reauthorized by the Board of Medicine.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 24, ch. 97-264; s. 1, ch. 2009-177.</History></Section>
