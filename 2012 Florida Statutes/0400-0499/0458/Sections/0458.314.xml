The board with the cooperation of the department shall identify, by rule, the standards and review procedures and methodology to be used in the certification process consistent with this subsection.

A school granted full certification shall provide evidence of continued compliance with this section. In the event that the department denies certification or recertification, the department shall give the school a specific listing of deficiencies which caused the department to disapprove it and what the department will require for compliance and shall permit the school, upon request, to demonstrate by satisfactory evidence, within 90 days, that it has remedied the deficiencies enumerated by the department.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A school shall pay a registration fee established by rule of the department, not to exceed $1,000, at the time of application for certification and shall pay all reasonable costs and expenses the department expects to incur, in an amount not to exceed $40,000, for the conduct of the certification survey.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall renew a certification upon receipt of a renewal application from an institution and a fee not to exceed $500.
