In connection with such projects, any such housing authority may enter into such leases or purchase agreements, accept such conveyances and rent or sell dwellings forming part of such projects to or for farmers of low income, as such housing authority deems necessary in order to assure the achievement of the objectives of this law. Such leases, agreements or conveyances may include such covenants as the housing authority deems appropriate regarding such dwellings and the tracts of land described in any such instrument, which covenants shall be deemed to run with the land where the housing authority deems it necessary and the parties to such instrument so stipulate. In providing housing for farmers of low income, county housing authorities and regional housing authorities shall not be subject to the limitations provided in ss. 421.08(3) and 421.10(3). Nothing contained in this section shall be construed as limiting any other powers of any housing authority.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 20220, 1941; s. 3, ch. 65-223.</History></Section>
