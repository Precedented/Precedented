Such applications shall be received and examined by housing authorities in connection with the formulation of projects or programs to provide housing for farmers of low income. Provided, however, that if it becomes necessary for an applicant under this section to convey any portion of the applicant’s then homestead in order to take advantages as provided herein, then in that event, the parting with title to a portion of said homestead shall not affect the remaining portion of same, but all rights that said owner may have in and to same under and by virtue of the Constitution of the state or any law passed pursuant thereto, shall be deemed and held to apply to such remaining portion of said land, the title of which remains in said applicant; it being the intention of the Legislature to permit the owner of any farm operated or worked upon by farmers of low income in need of safe and sanitary housing to take advantage of the provisions of this law without jeopardizing their rights in their then homestead by reason of any requirement that may be necessary in order for them to receive the benefits herein provided; and no court shall ever construe that an applicant who has taken advantage of this law has in any manner, shape, or form abandoned his or her rights in any property that is the applicant’s then homestead by virtue of such action upon his or her part, but it shall be held, construed, and deemed that such action upon the part of any applicant hereunder was not any abandonment of the applicant’s then homestead, and that all rights that the applicant then had therein shall be and remain as provided by the Constitution and any law enacted pursuant thereto.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 20220, 1941; s. 7, ch. 22858, 1945; s. 88, ch. 97-103; s. 85, ch. 2000-153.</History></Section>
