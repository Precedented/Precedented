The Legislature recognizes that there are Floridians with special health care and social needs which require particular attention. The people served by the Department of Children and Family Services, the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Health, and the Department of Elderly Affairs are examples of citizens with special needs. The Legislature further recognizes that the Medicaid program is an intricate part of the service delivery system for the special needs citizens. However, the Agency for Health Care Administration is not a service provider and does not develop or direct programs for the special needs citizens. Therefore, it is the intent of the Legislature that the Agency for Health Care Administration work closely with the Department of Children and Family Services, the Agency for Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Health, and the Department of Elderly Affairs in developing plans for assuring access to all Floridians in order to assure that the needs of special citizens are met.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 18, ch. 93-129; s. 179, ch. 99-8; s. 13, ch. 2000-209; s. 83, ch. 2004-267.</History></Section>
