Each day of violation constitutes a separate violation and is subject to a separate fine. For fines imposed by final order of the agency and not subject to further appeal, the violator shall pay the fine plus interest at the rate specified in s. 55.03 for each day beyond the date set by the agency for payment of the fine.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Violations of this part, authorizing statutes, or applicable rules shall be classified according to the nature of the violation and the gravity of its probable effect on clients. The scope of a violation may be cited as an isolated, patterned, or widespread deficiency. An isolated deficiency is a deficiency affecting one or a very limited number of clients, or involving one or a very limited number of staff, or a situation that occurred only occasionally or in a very limited number of locations. A patterned deficiency is a deficiency in which more than a very limited number of clients are affected, or more than a very limited number of staff are involved, or the situation has occurred in several locations, or the same client or clients have been affected by repeated occurrences of the same deficient practice but the effect of the deficient practice is not found to be pervasive throughout the provider. A widespread deficiency is a deficiency in which the problems causing the deficiency are pervasive in the provider or represent systemic failure that has affected or has the potential to affect a large portion of the provider’s clients. This subsection does not affect the legislative determination of the amount of a fine imposed under authorizing statutes. Violations shall be classified on the written notice as follows:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Class “I” violations are those conditions or occurrences related to the operation and maintenance of a provider or to the care of clients which the agency determines present an imminent danger to the clients of the provider or a substantial probability that death or serious physical or emotional harm would result therefrom. The condition or practice constituting a class I violation shall be abated or eliminated within 24 hours, unless a fixed period, as determined by the agency, is required for correction. The agency shall impose an administrative fine as provided by law for a cited class I violation. A fine shall be levied notwithstanding the correction of the violation.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Class “II” violations are those conditions or occurrences related to the operation and maintenance of a provider or to the care of clients which the agency determines directly threaten the physical or emotional health, safety, or security of the clients, other than class I violations. The agency shall impose an administrative fine as provided by law for a cited class II violation. A fine shall be levied notwithstanding the correction of the violation.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Class “III” violations are those conditions or occurrences related to the operation and maintenance of a provider or to the care of clients which the agency determines indirectly or potentially threaten the physical or emotional health, safety, or security of clients, other than class I or class II violations. The agency shall impose an administrative fine as provided in this section for a cited class III violation. A citation for a class III violation must specify the time within which the violation is required to be corrected. If a class III violation is corrected within the time specified, a fine may not be imposed.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Class “IV” violations are those conditions or occurrences related to the operation and maintenance of a provider or to required reports, forms, or documents that do not have the potential of negatively affecting clients. These violations are of a type that the agency determines do not threaten the health, safety, or security of clients. The agency shall impose an administrative fine as provided in this section for a cited class IV violation. A citation for a class IV violation must specify the time within which the violation is required to be corrected. If a class IV violation is corrected within the time specified, a fine may not be imposed.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The agency may impose an administrative fine for a violation that is not designated as a class I, class II, class III, or class IV violation. Unless otherwise specified by law, the amount of the fine may not exceed $500 for each violation.
