A major impediment to the provision of adequate and economic emergency medical services to all citizens is the inability of governmental and private agencies within a service area to respond cooperatively in order to finance the systematic provision of such services. This grant program is established to encourage and assist such cooperative efforts.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 73-262.</History></Section>
