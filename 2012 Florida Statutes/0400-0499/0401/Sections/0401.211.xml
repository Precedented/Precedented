In addition, that system of care must be equally capable of assessing, treating, and transporting children, adults, and frail elderly persons. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature to encourage the development and maintenance of emergency medical services because such services are essential to the health and well-being of all citizens of the state. The Legislature also recognizes that the establishment of a comprehensive statewide injury-prevention program supports state and community health systems by further enhancing the total delivery system of emergency medical services and reduces injuries for all persons. The purpose of this part is to protect and enhance the public health, welfare, and safety through the establishment of an emergency medical services state plan, an advisory council, a comprehensive statewide injury-prevention program, minimum standards for emergency medical services personnel, vehicles, services and medical direction, and the establishment of a statewide inspection program created to monitor the quality of patient care delivered by each licensed service and appropriately certified personnel.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 3, 25, ch. 82-402; ss. 1, 13, ch. 83-196; s. 3, ch. 84-317; s. 53, ch. 86-220; s. 12, ch. 89-275; s. 10, ch. 89-283; ss. 2, 36, ch. 92-78; s. 35, ch. 2004-350.</History></Section>
