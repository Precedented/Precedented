The practice of orthotics or pedorthics by a pharmacist or any of the pharmacist’s employees acting under the supervision of a pharmacist shall be construed to be within the meaning of the term “practice of the profession of pharmacy” as set forth in s. 465.003(13), and shall be subject to regulation in the same manner as any other pharmacy practice. The Board of Pharmacy shall develop rules regarding the practice of orthotics and pedorthics by a pharmacist. Any pharmacist or person under the supervision of a pharmacist engaged in the practice of orthotics or pedorthics is not precluded from continuing that practice pending adoption of these rules.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 2009-202.</History></Section>
