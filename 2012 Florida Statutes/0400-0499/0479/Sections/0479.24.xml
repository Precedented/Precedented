<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0479.24" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Compensation for removal of signs; eminent domain; exceptions.</Catchline><SectionBody><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Just compensation shall be paid by the department upon the department’s removal of a lawful nonconforming sign along any portion of the interstate or federal-aid primary highway system. This section does not apply to a sign which is illegal at the time of its removal. A sign will lose its nonconforming status and become illegal at such time as it fails to be permitted or maintained in accordance with all applicable laws, rules, ordinances, or regulations other than the provision which makes it nonconforming. A legal nonconforming sign under state law or rule will not lose its nonconforming status solely because it additionally becomes nonconforming under an ordinance or regulation of a local governmental entity passed at a later date. The department shall make every reasonable effort to negotiate the purchase of the signs to avoid litigation and congestion in the courts.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department is not required to remove any sign under this section if the federal share of the just compensation to be paid upon removal of the sign is not available to make such payment, unless an appropriation by the Legislature for such purpose is made to the department.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department is authorized to use the power of eminent domain when necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If eminent domain procedures are instituted, just compensation shall be made pursuant to the state’s eminent domain procedures, chapters 73 and 74.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 9, ch. 71-971; s. 5, ch. 75-202; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 1, ch. 77-174; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 19, 25, 26, ch. 84-227; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 42, ch. 94-237.</History></Section>
