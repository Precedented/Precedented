		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In order that the state may achieve its full economic and social potential, consideration must be given to rural workforce training and development to enable its rural citizens as well as urban citizens to develop their maximum capacities and participate productively in our society. It is, therefore, the policy of the state to make available those services needed to assist individuals and communities in rural areas to improve their quality of life. It is with a great sense of urgency that a Rural Workforce Services Program is established within the Department of Economic Opportunity, under the direction of Workforce Florida, Inc., to provide equal access to all manpower training programs available to rural as well as urban areas.</Text>
