The party states further recognize that the Congress of the United States, by enacting the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, 94 Stat. 3347, has provided for and encouraged the development of low-level radioactive waste compacts as a tool for disposal of such waste. The party states recognize that the safe and efficient management of low-level radioactive waste generated within the region requires that sufficient capacity to dispose of such waste be properly provided.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(2) It is the policy of the party states to:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(a) Enter into a regional low-level radioactive waste management compact for the purpose of providing the instrument and framework for a cooperative effort;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(b) Provide sufficient facilities for the proper management of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(c) Promote the health and safety of the region;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(d) Limit the number of facilities required to effectively and efficiently manage low-level radioactive waste generated in the region;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(e) Encourage the reduction of the amounts of low-level radioactive waste generated in the region;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(f) Distribute the costs, benefits, and obligations of successful low-level radioactive waste management equitably among the party states; and</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(g) Ensure the ecological and economical management of low-level radioactive waste.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(3) Implicit in the congressional consent to this compact is the expectation by the Congress and the party states that the appropriate federal agencies will actively assist the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Commission and the individual party states to this compact by:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(a) Expeditious enforcement of federal rules, regulations, and laws;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(b) Imposing sanctions against those found to be in violation of federal rules, regulations, and laws;</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(c) Timely inspection of their licensees to determine their capability to adhere to such rules, regulations, and laws; and</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(d) Timely provision of technical assistance to this compact in carrying out their obligations under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act, as amended.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">ARTICLE II</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent" SpaceAbove="true">DEFINITIONS.—As used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction, the term:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(1) “Commission” or “compact commission” means the Southeast Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Commission.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(2) “Facility” means a parcel of land, together with the structures, equipment, and improvements thereon or appurtenant thereto, which is used or is being developed for the treatment, storage, or disposal of low-level radioactive waste.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">(3) “Generator” means any person who produces or possesses low-level radioactive waste in the course of or as an incident to manufacturing, power generation, processing, medical diagnosis and treatment, research, or other industrial or commercial activity.
