		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This chapter does not prohibit a person from holding a license as an embalmer and a license as a funeral director at the same time. There may be issued and renewed by the licensing authority a combination license as both funeral director and embalmer to persons meeting the separate requirements for both licenses as set forth in this chapter. The licensing authority may adopt rules providing procedures for applying for and renewing such combination license. The licensing authority may by rule establish application, renewal, and other fees for such combination license, which fees shall not exceed the sum of the maximum fees for the separate funeral director and embalmer license categories as provided in this chapter. Persons holding a combination license as a funeral director and an embalmer shall be subject to regulation under this chapter both as a funeral director and an embalmer.</Text>
