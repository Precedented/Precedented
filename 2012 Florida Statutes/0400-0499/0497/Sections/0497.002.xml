Therefore, it is necessary in the interest of the public welfare to regulate preneed sales and cemeteries in this state. However, restrictions shall be imposed only to the extent necessary to protect the public from significant or discernible harm or damage and not in a manner which will unreasonably affect the competitive market.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Subject to certain interests of society, the Legislature finds that every competent adult has the right to control the decisions relating to her or his own funeral arrangements. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated herein, it is the Legislature’s express intent that nothing contained in this chapter should be construed or interpreted in any manner as to subject preneed contract purchasers to federal income taxation under the grantor trust rules contained in ss. 671 et seq. of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature deems it necessary in the interest of public health and safety to establish minimum qualifications for entry into the professions and occupations of embalming, funeral directing, cremation, direct disposition, and monument sales; to regulate such activities; and to provide for swift and effective discipline for those practitioners who violate the law.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 2, 40, ch. 80-238; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; s. 1, ch. 89-8; ss. 37, 122, ch. 93-399; s. 1, ch. 96-400; s. 1141, ch. 97-103; s. 4, ch. 2004-301.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 559.305.</Text></Note></Section>
