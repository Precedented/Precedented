<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><Section Number="0497.262" xmlns="http://StatRev.xsd"><Catchline xml:space="preserve">Duty of care and maintenance of licensed cemetery.</Catchline><SectionBody><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Every cemetery company or other entity responsible for the care and maintenance of a licensed cemetery in this state shall ensure that the grounds, structures, and other improvements of the cemetery are well cared for and maintained in a proper and dignified condition. The licensing authority shall adopt, by no later than July 1, 1999, such rules as are necessary to implement and enforce this section. In developing and adopting such rules, the licensing authority may define different classes of cemeteries or care and maintenance, and may provide for different rules to apply to each of said classes, if the designation of classes and the application of different rules is in the public interest and is supported by findings by the licensing authority based on evidence of industry practices, economic and physical feasibility, location, or intended uses; provided, that the rules shall provide minimum standards applicable to all cemeteries. For example, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the licensing authority may determine that a small rural cemetery with large trees and shade area does not require, and may not be able to attain, the same level of lawn care as a large urban cemetery with large open grassy areas and sprinkler systems.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 98-268; s. 44, ch. 2004-301.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 497.0255.</Text></Note></Section>
