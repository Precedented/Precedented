The Legislature finds that hospice care provides a cost-effective and less intrusive form of medical care while meeting the social, psychological, and spiritual needs of terminally ill patients and their families. The intent of this part is to provide for the development, establishment, and enforcement of basic standards to ensure the safe and adequate care of persons receiving hospice services.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 93-179.</History></Section>
