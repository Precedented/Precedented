Multiphasic health testing centers provide to people certain health testing services that are either performed at the center or involve the sending of specimens to a clinical laboratory. Unreliable or inaccurate reports and findings may cause unnecessary anxiety, suffering, and financial expense for individuals or may create a false and injudicious sense of security with respect to the state of an individual’s health, and may even contribute directly to an individual’s death. Therefore, the Legislature finds and declares that the protection of the public health requires the licensing of such centers, the establishment of certain minimum standards, and other necessary safeguards as authorized by this part.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-48; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 29, 30, ch. 83-276; ss. 2, 19, ch. 93-40; s. 25, ch. 93-178.</History></Section>
