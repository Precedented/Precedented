Clinical laboratories provide essential services to practitioners of the healing arts by furnishing vital information that is essential to a determination of the nature, cause, and extent of the condition involved. Unreliable and inaccurate reports can cause unnecessary anxiety, suffering, financial burdens, and even contribute directly to death. The protection of public and individual health requires licensure of clinical laboratories and the meeting of certain minimum standards, as well as certain other necessary safeguards as authorized by this part. The Legislature intends that, in keeping with federal law and regulations, clinical laboratories, regardless of location, size, or type, meet appropriate standards.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 67-248; s. 3, ch. 76-168; s. 2, ch. 77-48; s. 1, ch. 77-457; ss. 2, 3, ch. 81-318; ss. 29, 30, ch. 83-276; s. 27, ch. 92-58; s. 19, ch. 93-40; ss. 1, 25, ch. 93-178.</History></Section>
