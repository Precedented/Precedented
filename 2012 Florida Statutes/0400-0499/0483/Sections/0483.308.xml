In a contract multiphasic health testing center, electrocardiograms and X rays must be read and interpreted by the medical director of the contract center or respectively by a board-certified cardiologist or radiologist authorized by the medical director to read and interpret the electrocardiograms and X rays and report results to the medical director. Such secondary authorization by the medical director of the contract multiphasic health testing center does not operate to cede liability or responsibility for the test results to the board-certified cardiologist or radiologist. The medical director need not be present at the center while it is in operation. However, the medical director is responsible for assuring the proper clinical operation of the center.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The medical director shall order all requests by the center for analyses to be conducted by clinical laboratories with respect to specimens collected at the center. The results of such analyses, together with the results of any measurements or other testing procedures performed at the center, including electrocardiographic interpretations, shall be released to the medical director. The medical director of a consumer multiphasic health testing center shall read, interpret, and sign the results before they are released by the center to the patient. The medical director of a contract multiphasic health testing center shall read, interpret, and sign the results before they are released to the patient or may authorize the medical director of the contracting employer to read, interpret, and sign the results before they are released to the patient. Such secondary authorization by the medical director of the contract multiphasic health testing center does not operate to cede liability or responsibility for the test results to the medical director of the contracting employer. As a part of the required interpretation of any results from analyses conducted by a clinical laboratory, the medical director is responsible for determining whether the results indicate further medical advice or intervention is necessary. If the medical director so determines, then a statement to that effect must be included with the results together with a statement that the patient should seek medical advice from her or his physician or the county medical society with specific reference to the society’s name, address, and telephone number. Notification under this subsection must be made by regular mail.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-48; s. 2, ch. 81-318; ss. 29, 30, ch. 83-276; ss. 10, 19, ch. 93-40; s. 25, ch. 93-178; s. 21, ch. 97-98; s. 440, ch. 97-103.</History></Section>
