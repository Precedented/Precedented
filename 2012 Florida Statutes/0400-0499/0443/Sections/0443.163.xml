			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An employer may file any report and remit any contributions or reimbursements required under this chapter by electronic means. The Department of Economic Opportunity or the state agency providing reemployment assistance tax collection services shall adopt rules prescribing the format and instructions necessary for electronically filing reports and remitting contributions and reimbursements to ensure a full collection of contributions and reimbursements due. The acceptable method of transfer, the method, form, and content of the electronic means, and the method, if any, by which the employer will be provided with an acknowledgment shall be prescribed by the department or its tax collection service provider. However, any employer who employed 10 or more employees in any quarter during the preceding state fiscal year must file the Employers Quarterly Reports (UCT-6) for the current calendar year and remit the contributions and reimbursements due by electronic means approved by the tax collection service provider. A person who prepared and reported for 100 or more employers in any quarter during the preceding state fiscal year must file the Employers Quarterly Reports (UCT-6) for each calendar quarter in the current calendar year, beginning with reports due for the second calendar quarter of 2003, by electronic means approved by the tax collection service provider.</Text>

This penalty is in addition to any other penalty provided by this chapter. However, the penalty does not apply if the tax collection service provider waives the electronic filing requirement in advance. An employer who fails to remit contributions or reimbursements by approved electronic means as required by law is liable for a penalty of $50 for each remittance submitted by a means other than approved electronic means. This penalty is in addition to any other penalty provided by this chapter.</Text>
