Such officials shall cooperate with the division in carrying out the purpose of this part insofar as their duties and facilities permit, but the division may not delegate any of its duties and responsibilities under this part to any other agency or individual except with respect to persons for whom a vocational rehabilitation plan has been approved by the division or by a member of its staff to whom it has delegated authority to approve individual vocational rehabilitation plans. However, nothing in this part shall be so construed as to prevent other agencies from rendering services to persons who have disabilities, which services are not designed especially for the purpose of vocationally rehabilitating such persons or services to which such persons might be entitled without regard to their disabilities.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 15, ch. 25364, 1949; s. 13, ch. 65-239; ss. 19, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 314, ch. 77-147; s. 116, ch. 79-164; s. 10, ch. 87-227; s. 20, ch. 94-324.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former ss. 229.39, 229.0116.</Text></Note></Section>
