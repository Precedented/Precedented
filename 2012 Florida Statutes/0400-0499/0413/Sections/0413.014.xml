The division shall, as rapidly as feasible, increase the amount of such services provided by community rehabilitation programs. The goal shall be to decrease the amount of such services provided by division employees and to increase to the maximum extent allowed by federal law the amount of such services provided through cooperative agreements with community service providers. The division shall seek, to the maximum extent allowed by federal and state law and regulation, all available federal funds for such purposes. Funds and in-kind matching contributions from community and private sources shall be used to maximize federal funds. Unless prohibited by federal law or regulation, the share of the federal vocational rehabilitation grant apportioned for services to the blind may not be less than 17 percent.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 16, ch. 95-327; s. 8, ch. 2004-331.</History></Section>
