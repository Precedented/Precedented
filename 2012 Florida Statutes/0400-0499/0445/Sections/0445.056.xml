		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Economic Opportunity shall implement the matching grant program established by the former Agency for Workforce Innovation to award matching grants to private sector employers in this state which provide wages to employees serving in the United States Armed Forces Reserves or the Florida National Guard while those employees are on federal active duty. A grant may not be provided for federal active duty served before January 1, 2005. Each grant shall be awarded to reimburse the employer for not more than one-half of the monthly wages paid to an employee who is a resident of this state for the actual period of federal active duty. The monthly grant per employee may not exceed one-half of the difference between the amount of monthly wages paid by the employer to the employee at the level paid before the date the employee was called to federal active duty and the amount of the employee’s active duty base pay, housing and variable allowances, and subsistence allowance. The Department of Economic Opportunity shall implement the plan administered by the former Agency for Workforce Innovation.</Text>
