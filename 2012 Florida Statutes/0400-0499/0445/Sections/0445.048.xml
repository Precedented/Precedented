				<SubParagraph Id="1">

				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Having incomes below 200 percent of the federal poverty level makes such individuals particularly vulnerable to reliance on public assistance despite their best efforts to achieve or maintain economic independence through employment.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Workforce Florida, Inc., in cooperation with the Department of Children and Family Services and the Department of Economic Opportunity, shall offer performance-based incentive bonuses as a component of the Passport to Economic Progress program. The bonuses do not represent a program entitlement and shall be contingent on achieving specific benchmarks prescribed in the self-sufficiency plan. If the funds appropriated for this purpose are insufficient to provide this financial incentive, the board of directors of Workforce Florida, Inc., may reduce or suspend the bonuses in order not to exceed the appropriation or may direct the regional boards to use resources otherwise given to the regional workforce to pay such bonuses if such payments comply with applicable state and federal laws.</Text>
