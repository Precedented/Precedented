The Legislature recognizes that untrained persons, unlicensed persons or businesses, or persons who are not of good moral character engaged in the private security, investigative, and recovery industries are a threat to the welfare of the public if placed in positions of trust. Regulation of licensed and unlicensed persons and businesses engaged in these fields is therefore deemed necessary.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 2, 11, ch. 90-364; s. 4, ch. 91-429; s. 1, ch. 94-172.</History></Section>
