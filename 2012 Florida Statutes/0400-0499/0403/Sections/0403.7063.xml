Notwithstanding any special or general law to the contrary, no county or municipality shall adopt or enforce regulations that discriminate against privately owned solid waste management facilities because they are privately owned. However, nothing in this section shall interfere with the county’s or municipality’s ability to control the flow of solid waste within its boundaries pursuant to this chapter.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 62, ch. 88-130.</History></Section>
