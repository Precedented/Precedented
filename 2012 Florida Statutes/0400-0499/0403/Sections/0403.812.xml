The waters within such systems, unless designed, constructed, operated, and maintained for in-water recreational uses, such as swimming and boating, shall not be considered waters of the state; however, if the system provides other incidental uses and is accessible to the public, then the department may require reasonable assurance that water quality within the system will not adversely impact public health, fish and wildlife in adjacent waters, or adjacent waters. The department shall not require dredge and fill permits for structures designed solely to connect stormwater management systems to waters of the state provided that the connection of such system to waters of the state is regulated pursuant to chapter 373.
