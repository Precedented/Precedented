Such zones of discharge may be modified in accordance with procedures specified in department rules. Exceedance of primary and secondary groundwater standards that occur within a zone of discharge does not create liability pursuant to this chapter or chapter 376 for site cleanup, and the exceedance of soil cleanup target levels is not a basis for enforcement or site cleanup.</Text>
