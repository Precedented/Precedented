This definition specifically includes toe drain systems and ditches and other leachate collection systems but does not include conveyances within the confines of the fertilizer production plant or existing areas used in emergency circumstances caused by rainfall events of high volume or duration for the temporary storage of process wastewater to avoid discharges to surface waters of the state, which process wastewater must be removed from the temporary storage area as expeditiously as possible, but not to exceed 120 days after each emergency.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="f"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Process wastewater” means any water that, during manufacturing or processing, comes into direct contact with or results from the production or use of any raw material, intermediate product, finished product, byproduct, or waste product, along with any leachate or runoff from the phosphogypsum stack system.

A phosphogypsum stack system is presumed not to cause an imminent hazard if the physical condition and operation of the system are in compliance with all applicable department rules.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The failure of an owner or operator of a phosphogypsum stack system to comply with department rules requiring demonstration of closure financial responsibility may be considered by the department as evidence that a phosphogypsum stack poses an imminent hazard for purposes of initiating actions authorized by paragraph (d).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the department determines that the failure of an owner or operator to comply with department rules requiring demonstration of financial responsibility or that the physical condition, maintenance, operation, or closure of a phosphogypsum stack system poses an imminent hazard, the department shall request access to the property on which such stack system is located from the owner or operator of the stack system for the purposes of taking action to abate or substantially reduce the imminent hazard. If the department, after reasonable effort, is unable to timely obtain the necessary access to abate or substantially reduce the imminent hazard, the department may institute action in its own name, using the procedures and remedies of s. 403.121 or s. 403.131, to abate or substantially reduce an imminent hazard. Whenever serious harm to human health, safety, or welfare, to the environment, or to private or public property may occur prior to completion of an administrative hearing or other formal proceeding that might be initiated to abate the risk of serious harm, the department may obtain from the court, ex parte, an injunction without paying filing and service fees prior to the filing and service of process.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">To abate or substantially reduce an imminent hazard, the department may take any appropriate action, including, but not limited to, using employees of the department or contracting with other state or federal agencies, with private third-party contractors, or with the owner or operator of the stack system, or financing, compensating, or funding a receiver, trustee, or owner of the stack system, to perform all or part of the work.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="f"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall recover from the owner or operator of the phosphogypsum stack system to the use of the Nonmandatory Land Reclamation Trust Fund all moneys expended from the fund, including funds expended prior to the effective date of this section, to abate an imminent hazard posed by the phosphogypsum stack system plus a penalty equal to an amount calculated at 30 percent of such funds expended. This penalty shall be imposed annually, and prorated from the date of payment from the fund until the expended funds and the penalty are repaid. If the department prevails in any action to recover funds pursuant to this subsection, it may recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred. Phosphogypsum may not be deposited on a stack until all moneys expended from the fund in connection with the stack have been repaid, unless the department determines that such placement is necessary to abate or avoid an imminent hazard or unless otherwise authorized by the department.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="g"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department may impose a lien on the real property on which the phosphogypsum stack system that poses an imminent hazard is located and on the real property underlying and other assets located at associated phosphate fertilizer production facilities equal in amount to the moneys expended from the Nonmandatory Land Reclamation Trust Fund pursuant to paragraph (e), including attorney’s fees and court costs. The owner of any property on which such a lien is imposed is entitled to a release of the lien upon payment to the department of the lien amount. The lien imposed by this section does not take priority over any other prior perfected lien on the real property, personal property, or other assets referenced in this paragraph, including, but not limited to, the associated phosphate rock mine and reserves.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="h"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon a declaration by the Governor of an environmental emergency concerning the abatement of an imminent hazard involving a phosphogypsum stack or stack system, the state and any agent under contract with the state for the provision of services directly related to the abatement of such hazard shall not become liable under state laws for environmental protection for any costs, damages, or penalties associated with the abatement of the imminent hazard. The Legislature finds that provision of this limited immunity is in the public interest and necessary for the abatement of the imminent hazard.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">REGISTRATION FEES.<EmDash /></Text><Paragraph Id="a"><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The owner or operator of each existing phosphogypsum stack who has not provided a performance bond, letter of credit, trust fund agreement, or closure insurance to demonstrate financial responsibility for closure and long-term care shall pay to the department a fee as set forth in this paragraph.

To accomplish such closure and postclosure care, the department may take any appropriate action, including, but not limited to, using employees of the department or by contracting with other state or federal agencies, with private third-party contractors, or with the owner or operator of the stack system, to perform all or part of the work.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department may close a phosphogypsum stack system through agreement with the owner or by court order. In determining whether closure is appropriate, the court shall consider whether closing the stack will protect human health, safety, or welfare or the environment; the useful life of the stack; the effect of delaying closure on the stability of the fund; the likelihood that the stack will be operated again; and any other relevant factors. If the court finds that closure is appropriate, the court may appoint a receiver to oversee the closure or shall authorize department employees, agents, and contractors to enter all land owned by the owner of the phosphogypsum stack system for the performance of closure and postclosure activities.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department may impose a lien on the real property on which a closed phosphogypsum stack system is located and on the real property underlying and other assets located at its formerly associated phosphate fertilizer production facilities equal in amount to the moneys expended from the Nonmandatory Land Reclamation Trust Fund pursuant to this subsection for closure and postclosure care. The owner of any property on which such a lien is imposed is entitled to a release of the lien upon payment to the department of the lien amount and execution of an agreement to carry out postclosure care in accordance with applicable department rules. The lien imposed by this section does not take priority over any other prior perfected lien on the real property, personal property, or other assets referenced in this paragraph, including, but not limited to, the associated phosphate rock mine and reserves.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 62, ch. 93-207; s. 382, ch. 94-356; s. 3, ch. 2001-134; s. 8, ch. 2003-423; s. 64, ch. 2005-2.</History></Section>
