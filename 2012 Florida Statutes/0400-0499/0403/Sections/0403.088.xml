			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Without the written authorization of the department, a person may not discharge any waste into the waters of the state which, by itself or in combination with the wastes of other sources, reduces the quality of the receiving waters below the classification established for such waters. However, this section does not prohibit the application of pesticides to such waters for the control of insects, aquatic weeds, algae, or other pests if the application is performed in accordance with this section.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall also enter into agreements with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in the case of insect or other pest control, and with the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission in the case of aquatic weed, other aquatic pests, or algae control. Such agreements must provide for public health, welfare, and safety, as well as environmental factors, and must ensure that pesticides applied to waters of the state are regulated uniformly, including provisions for the coordination of agency staff and resources, through the implementation of permitting, compliance, and enforcement activities under s. 403.0885 and this section. Pesticides that are approved for a particular use by the United States Environmental Protection Agency or by the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and applied in accordance with registered label instructions, state standards for such application, including any permit or other authorization required by this subsection, and the Florida Pesticide Law, part I of chapter 487, are allowed a temporary deviation from the acute toxicity provisions of the department’s rule establishing surface water quality standards, not to exceed the time necessary to control the target pests and only if the application does not reduce the quality of the receiving waters below the classification for such waters and is not likely to adversely affect any threatened or endangered species.</Text>
