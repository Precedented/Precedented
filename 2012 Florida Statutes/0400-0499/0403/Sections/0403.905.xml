In the event that the abutting upland owner does not remove such fill as directed, the department or board may remove it at its own expense, and the costs of removal will become a lien upon the property of such abutting upland owner. However, the department and board may, if they choose, allow such fill to remain as state-owned land and may employ a surveyor to determine the boundary between such state land and that of the abutting upland owner. The amount of the cost of such survey will become a lien on the property of the abutting upland owner. Nothing herein may be construed to grant the department or the board authority to direct an upland owner to adjust, alter, or remove silt, fill, or other solid material which has accumulated or has been deposited seaward of his or her property, through no fault of the owner.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 38, ch. 93-213; s. 20, ch. 97-103.</History><Note Reference="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Sections 403.91-403.925 and 403.929 were repealed by s. 45, ch. 93-213, and s. 403.913, as amended by s. 46, ch. 93-213, was transferred to s. 403.939 and subsequently repealed by s. 18, ch. 95-145.
