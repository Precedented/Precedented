In order to promote the state objective of alternative water supply development, including the use of demineralization technologies, and to encourage the conservation and protection of the state’s natural resources, the concentrate resulting from demineralization must be classified as potable water byproduct regardless of flow quantity and must be appropriately treated and discharged or reused.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purposes of this section, the term:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Demineralization concentrate” means the concentrated byproduct water, brine, or reject water produced by ion exchange or membrane separation technologies such as reverse osmosis, membrane softening, ultrafiltration, membrane filtration, electrodialysis, and electrodialysis reversal used for desalination, softening, or reducing total dissolved solids during water treatment for public water supply purposes.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Small water utility business” means any facility that distributes potable water to two or more customers with a concentrate discharge of less than 50,000 gallons per day.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall initiate rulemaking no later than October 1, 2001, to address facilities that discharge demineralization concentrate. The department shall convene a technical advisory committee to assist in the development of the rules, which committee shall include one representative each from the demineralization industry, local government, water and wastewater utilities, the engineering profession, business, and environmental organizations. The technical advisory committee shall also include one member representing the five water management districts and one representative from the Fish and Wildlife Research Institute. In convening the technical advisory committee, consideration must be given to geographical balance.
