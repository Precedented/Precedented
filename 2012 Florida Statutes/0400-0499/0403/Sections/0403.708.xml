				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Yard trash in lined landfills classified by department rule as Class I landfills, unless the Class I landfill uses an active gas-collection system to collect landfill gas generated at the disposal facility and provides or arranges for a beneficial use of the gas. A Class I landfill may also accept yard trash for the purpose of mulching and using the yard trash to provide landfill cover for municipal solid waste disposed at the landfill. The department shall, by rule, develop and adopt a methodology to award recycling credit for the use or disposal of yard trash at a Class I landfill having a gas-collection system that makes beneficial use of the collected landfill gas. A qualifying permitted Class I landfill must obtain a minor permit modification to its operating permit which describes the beneficial use being made of the landfill gas and modifies the facility’s operation plan before receiving yard trash as authorized under this subparagraph. The permittee must certify that gas collection and beneficial use will continue after closure of the disposal facility that is accepting yard trash. If the landfill is located in a county that owns and operates a compost facility, waste-to-energy facility, or biomass facility that sells renewable energy to a public utility and that is authorized to accept yard trash, the department shall provide the county with notice of, and opportunity to comment on, the application for permit modification.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Yard trash that is source separated from solid waste may be accepted at a solid waste disposal area if separate yard trash composting facilities are provided and maintained. The department recognizes that incidental amounts of yard trash may be disposed of in Class I landfills. In any enforcement action taken pursuant to this paragraph, the department shall consider the difficulty of removing incidental amounts of yard trash from a mixed solid waste stream. This limited exception applies in all units of local government, including, but not limited to, municipalities, counties, and special districts. However, the exception does not apply to a county that currently operates under a constitutional home rule charter authorized in 1956 in a statewide referendum. The limited exception to the ban on disposing of yard trash in a Class I landfill is not intended to have a material impact on current operations at existing waste-to-energy or biomass facilities.</Text>
