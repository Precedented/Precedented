Further, for maintenance dredging of previously dredged portions of natural water bodies within recorded drainage rights-of-way or drainage easements, an entity that seeks an exemption must notify the department or water management district, as applicable, at least 30 days prior to dredging and provide documentation of original design specifications or configurations where such exist. This exemption applies to all canals and previously dredged portions of natural water bodies within recorded drainage rights-of-way or drainage easements constructed prior to April 3, 1970, and to those canals and previously dredged portions of natural water bodies constructed on or after April 3, 1970, pursuant to all necessary state permits. This exemption does not apply to the removal of a natural or manmade barrier separating a canal or canal system from adjacent waters. When no previous permit has been issued by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund or the United States Army Corps of Engineers for construction or maintenance dredging of the existing manmade canal or intake or discharge structure, such maintenance dredging shall be limited to a depth of no more than 5 feet below mean low water. The Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund may fix and recover from the permittee an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value and the actual cost of the maintenance dredging for material removed during such maintenance dredging. However, no charge shall be exacted by the state for material removed during such maintenance dredging by a public port authority.

In the case of insect control structures, if the cost of using a self-contained upland spoil site is so excessive, as determined by the Department of Health, pursuant to s. 403.088(1), that it will inhibit proposed insect control, then-existing spoil sites or dikes may be used, upon notification to the department. In the case of insect control where upland spoil sites are not used pursuant to this exemption, turbidity control devices shall be used to confine the spoil material discharge to that area previously disturbed when the receiving body of water is used as a potable water supply, is designated as shellfish harvesting waters, or functions as a habitat for commercially or recreationally important shellfish or finfish.

			<Paragraph Id="g">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This subsection does not prohibit maintenance dredging of areas where the loss of original design function and constructed configuration has been caused by a storm event, provided that the dredging is performed as soon as practical after the storm event. Maintenance dredging that commences within 3 years after the storm event shall be presumed to satisfy this provision. If more than 3 years are needed to commence the maintenance dredging after the storm event, a request for a specific time extension to perform the maintenance dredging shall be submitted to the department, prior to the end of the 3-year period, accompanied by a statement, including supporting documentation, demonstrating that contractors are not available or that additional time is needed to obtain authorization for the maintenance dredging from the United States Army Corps of Engineers.</Text>
