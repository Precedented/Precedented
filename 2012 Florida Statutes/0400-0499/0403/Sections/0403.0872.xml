		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Provided that program approval pursuant to 42 U.S.C. s. 7661a has been received from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, beginning January 2, 1995, each major source of air pollution, including electrical power plants certified under s. 403.511, must obtain from the department an operation permit for a major source of air pollution under this section. This operation permit is the only department operation permit for a major source of air pollution required for such source; provided, at the applicant’s request, the department shall issue a separate acid rain permit for a major source of air pollution that is an affected source within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. s. 7651a(1). Operation permits for major sources of air pollution, except general permits issued pursuant to s. 403.814, must be issued in accordance with the procedures contained in this section and in accordance with chapter 120; however, to the extent that chapter 120 is inconsistent with the provisions of this section, the procedures contained in this section prevail.</Text>

The department shall adopt rules defining the timing, content, and distribution of an application for a permit under this section. A permit application processing fee is not required. The department may issue an operation permit for a major source of air pollution only when it has reasonable assurance that the source applies pollution control technology, including fuel or raw material selection, necessary to enable it to comply with the standards or rules adopted by the department or an approved compliance plan for that source. If two or more major air pollution sources that belong to the same Major Group as described in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1987, are operated at a single site, the owner may elect to receive a single operation permit covering all such sources at the site.</Text>

If the department proposes to deny the permit application, the department’s determination must provide an explanation for the denial. The department shall furnish a copy of each draft permit to the United States Environmental Protection Agency and to any contiguous state whose air quality could be affected or which is within 50 miles of the source pursuant to procedures established by department rule.</Text>

Within 45 days after the date on which the department serves the applicant with a copy of an objection by the United States Environmental Protection Agency to a proposed permit, the applicant may file a written reply to the objection. The written reply must include any supporting materials that the applicant desires to include in the record relevant to the issues raised by the objection. The written reply must be considered by the department in issuing a final permit to resolve the objection of the administrator.

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each major source of air pollution permitted to operate in this state must pay between January 15 and March 1 of each year, upon written notice from the department, an annual operation license fee in an amount determined by department rule. The annual operation license fee shall be terminated immediately in the event the United States Environmental Protection Agency imposes annual fees solely to implement and administer the major source air-operation permit program in Florida under 40 C.F.R. s. 70.10(d).</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The annual fee must be assessed based upon the source’s previous year’s emissions and must be calculated by multiplying the applicable annual operation license fee factor times the tons of each regulated air pollutant (except carbon monoxide) allowed to be emitted per hour by specific condition of the source’s most recent construction or operation permit, times the annual hours of operation allowed by permit condition; provided, however, that:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The license fee factor is $25 or another amount determined by department rule which ensures that the revenue provided by each year’s operation license fees is sufficient to cover all reasonable direct and indirect costs of the major stationary source air-operation permit program established by this section. The license fee factor may be increased beyond $25 only if the secretary of the department affirmatively finds that a shortage of revenue for support of the major stationary source air-operation permit program will occur in the absence of a fee factor adjustment. The annual license fee factor may never exceed $35.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For any source that operates for fewer hours during the calendar year than allowed under its permit, the annual fee calculation must be based upon actual hours of operation rather than allowable hours if the owner or operator of the source documents the source’s actual hours of operation for the calendar year. For any source that has an emissions limit that is dependent upon the type of fuel burned, the annual fee calculation must be based on the emissions limit applicable during actual hours of operation.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For any source whose allowable emission limitation is specified by permit per units of material input or heat input or product output, the applicable input or production amount may be used to calculate the allowable emissions if the owner or operator of the source documents the actual input or production amount. If the input or production amount is not documented, the maximum allowable input or production amount specified in the permit must be used to calculate the allowable emissions.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="4">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For any new source that does not receive its first operation permit until after the beginning of a calendar year, the annual fee for the year must be reduced pro rata to reflect the period during which the source was not allowed to operate.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="5">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For any source that emits less of any regulated air pollutant than allowed by permit condition, the annual fee calculation for such pollutant must be based upon actual emissions rather than allowable emissions if the owner or operator documents the source’s actual emissions by means of data from a department-approved certified continuous emissions monitor or from an emissions monitoring method which has been approved by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the regulations implementing 42 U.S.C. ss. 7651 et seq., or from a method approved by the department for purposes of this section.</Text>

Any source, or group of sources, which does not emit any regulated air pollutant in excess of 4,000 tons per year, is allowed a one-time credit not to exceed 25 percent of the first annual licensing fee for the prorated portion of existing air-operation permit application fees remaining upon commencement of the annual licensing fees.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
				<SubParagraph Id="7">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the department has not received the fee by February 15 of the calendar year, the permittee must be sent a written warning of the consequences for failing to pay the fee by March 1. If the fee is not postmarked by March 1 of the calendar year, the department shall impose, in addition to the fee, a penalty of 50 percent of the amount of the fee, plus interest on such amount computed in accordance with s. 220.807. The department may not impose such penalty or interest on any amount underpaid, provided that the permittee has timely remitted payment of at least 90 percent of the amount determined to be due and remits full payment within 60 days after receipt of notice of the amount underpaid. The department may waive the collection of underpayment and shall not be required to refund overpayment of the fee, if the amount due is less than 1 percent of the fee, up to $50. The department may revoke any major air pollution source operation permit if it finds that the permitholder has failed to timely pay any required annual operation license fee, penalty, or interest.</Text>

Costs to issue and administer such permits shall be considered direct and indirect costs of the major stationary source air-operation permit program under s. 403.0873. The department shall, however, require fees pursuant to the provisions of s. 403.087(6)(a)5.a. for the construction of a new major source of air pollution that will be subject to the permitting requirements of this section once constructed and for activities triggering permitting requirements under Title I, Part C or Part D, of the federal Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ss. 7470-7514a.</Text>
