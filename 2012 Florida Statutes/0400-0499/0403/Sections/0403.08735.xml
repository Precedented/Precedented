The generic air emissions bubble rule shall eliminate the need for case-by-case federal determinations on individual emissions trades within a single facility as individual State Implementation Plan revisions. For purposes of promulgating a generic air emissions bubble rule:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The term “bubble” shall mean an air pollution control strategy which allows multiunit aggregate emission limits to be established within a facility, in lieu of unit-specific emission limits, on a pollutant-specific basis at the request of the facility owner or operator. The application of a bubble to a facility would allow emissions at one or more emissions points or units to fluctuate within a facility as long as the multiunit limit is not exceeded. Multiunit limits shall be established by aggregating unit-specific limits for all new or existing units being included in the bubble. The bubble shall also allow the department to establish, at the request of the owner or operator of a facility, alternative emission limits for individual units as long as the aggregated emissions limit for all involved units is not increased.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The term “facility” shall mean all emissions units that are located on one or more contiguous or adjacent properties that are under common control of the same person or persons. For purposes of this section, the terms “plantwide” and “facilitywide” are used interchangeably.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">VOLUNTARY LIMITS ON AIR EMISSIONS.<EmDash />The department shall adopt rules to allow facilities to voluntarily limit their emissions to avoid otherwise applicable requirements.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 95-292; s. 36, ch. 99-5.</History></Section>
