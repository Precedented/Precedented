			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except as provided in <Reference Number="1"/>s. 287.045, any state agency or agency of a political subdivision of the state which is using state funds, or any person contracting with any such agency with respect to work performed under contract, is required to procure products or materials with recycled content when the Department of Management Services determines that those products or materials are available. A decision not to procure such items must be based on the Department of Management Services’ determination that such procurement is not reasonably available within an acceptable period of time, fails to meet the performance standards set forth in the applicable specifications, or fails to meet the performance standards of the agency. When the requirements of <Reference Number="1"/>s. 287.045 are met, agencies shall be subject to the procurement requirements of that section for procuring products or materials with recycled content.</Text>
