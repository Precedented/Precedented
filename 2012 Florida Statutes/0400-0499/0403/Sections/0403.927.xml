			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature recognizes the great value of farming and forestry to this state and that continued agricultural activity is compatible with wetlands protection. In order to avoid unnecessary expense and delay from duplicative programs, it is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the construction and operation of agricultural water management systems under authority granted to water management districts and to control, by the department or by delegation of authority to water management districts, the ultimate discharge from agricultural water management systems.</Text>

Except for aquaculture water management systems located within waters of the state, the department shall not enforce water quality standards within an agricultural water management system. The department may require a stormwater permit or appropriate discharge permit at the ultimate point of discharge from an agricultural water management system or a group of connected agricultural water management systems. Impacts of agricultural activities and agricultural water management systems on groundwater quality shall be regulated by water management districts.</Text>

However, mitigation under chapter 373 or this chapter to offset any adverse effects caused by agricultural activities that occurred before the conversion of the land is not required if the activities occurred on the land in the last 4 years preceding the conversion.</Text>
