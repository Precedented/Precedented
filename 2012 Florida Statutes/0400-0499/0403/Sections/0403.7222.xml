However, hazardous waste may not be disposed of through an injection well or other subsurface method of disposal, which is defined as a Class IV well in 40 C.F.R. s. 144.6(d), except those Class I wells permitted for hazardous waste disposal as of January 1, 1992. The department shall annually review the operations of any such Class I well permitted as of January 1, 1992, and prepare a report analyzing any impact on groundwater systems. Nothing in this section shall be construed to refer to the products of membrane technology, including reverse osmosis, for the production of potable water where disposal is through a Class I well as defined in 40 C.F.R. s. 144.6(a), or to refer to remedial or corrective action activities conducted in accordance with 40 C.F.R. s. 144.13.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature declares that, due to the permeability of the soil and high water table in Florida, future hazardous waste landfills are prohibited. Therefore, the department may not issue a permit pursuant to s. 403.722 for a newly constructed hazardous waste landfill. However, if by executive order the Governor declares a hazardous waste management emergency, the department may issue a permit for a temporary hazardous waste landfill. Any such landfill shall be used only until such time as an appropriate alternative method of disposal can be derived and implemented. Such a permit may not be issued for a period exceeding 6 months without a further declaration of the Governor. A Class IV injection well, as defined in 40 C.F.R. s. 144.6(d), may not be permitted for construction or operation under this section.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This section does not prohibit the department from banning the disposal of hazardous waste in other types of waste management units in a manner consistent with federal requirements, except as provided under s. 403.804(2).</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 38, ch. 83-310; s. 36, ch. 86-186; s. 5, ch. 89-285; s. 64, ch. 90-331; s. 1, ch. 93-91; s. 409, ch. 94-356.</History></Section>
