Working with industry, business associations, other government agencies, and interested parties, the department is directed to consider specific limited pilot projects to test new compliance measures. These measures should include, but not be limited to, reducing transaction costs for business and government and providing economic incentives for emissions reductions. The department shall report to the Legislature prior to implementation of a pilot project initiated pursuant to this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 12, ch. 2000-304.</History></Section>
