Detailed construction plans and specifications shall not be required prior to issuance of a permit or a modification to a permit required under s. 403.087 or an operation permit required under s. 403.0885 unless such plans and specifications are required to secure federal funding and the project is expected to receive federal funding. Upon a demonstration that a system constructed in accordance with a construction permit issued pursuant to s. 403.087 operates as designed, the department shall issue a permit for operation of the system. However, an operation permit may be issued prior to the initiation of discharge, provided the department has reasonable assurance, based on the system design, that the provisions of s. 403.088 will be met.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 87-125; s. 75, ch. 93-213.</History></Section>
