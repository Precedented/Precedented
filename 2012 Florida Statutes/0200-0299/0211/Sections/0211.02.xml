			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purposes of this section, “value” means the sale price or market price of a barrel of oil at the mouth of the well in its natural, unrefined condition. If the oil is exchanged for something other than cash, if there is no sale at the mouth of the well, or if the sale price is not indicative of the true value or market price of the oil produced, value shall be determined by the sale price of oil of like kind and quality, considering any differences in the place of production or sale.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any charges prepaid by the producer or included in the invoice price for delivery of the oil shall be deducted from the gross proceeds of the sale which are used to determine the value of oil produced, provided the oil was sold at a delivered price.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The value of oil produced shall not include any wellhead or other production taxes imposed by the United States on the producer, to the extent that such taxes do not provide a credit or deduction for the tax imposed under this part.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The term “tertiary oil” means the excess barrels of oil produced, or estimated to be produced, as a result of the actual use of a tertiary recovery method in a qualified enhanced oil recovery project, over the barrels of oil which could have been produced by continued maximum feasible production methods in use prior to the start of tertiary recovery. A “qualified enhanced oil recovery project” means a project for enhancing recovery of oil which meets the requirements of 26 U.S.C. s. 43(c)(2) or substantially similar requirements.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Oil production shall be measured or gauged. Mechanical metering systems using meters of a type generally approved for use in the industry may be used to measure oil production. If tank tables are used to determine oil production, tables compiled to show 100 percent of the full capacity of tanks, without deduction for overage or losses in handling, shall be used; or the oil production shall be adjusted to a basis of 100 percent of the full capacity of tanks if oil production is determined using tank tables compiled to show less than 100 percent of the full capacity of tanks. Oil production shall be expressed in barrels.</Text>
