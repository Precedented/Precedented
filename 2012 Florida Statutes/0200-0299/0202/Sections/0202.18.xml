				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall make any adjustments to the distributions pursuant to this section which are necessary to reflect the proper amounts due to individual jurisdictions or trust funds.

				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<SubSubParagraph Id="a">
						<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Adjustments in distributions which are necessary to correct misallocations between jurisdictions shall be governed by this subparagraph. If the department determines that misallocations between jurisdictions occurred, it shall provide written notice of such determination to all affected jurisdictions. The notice shall include the amount of the misallocations, the basis upon which the determination was made, data supporting the determination, and the identity of each affected jurisdiction.

						<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If an adjustment affecting a distribution to a jurisdiction equals or exceeds 90 percent of the average monthly distribution to that jurisdiction for the 6 months immediately preceding the department’s determination, as reported by all communications services dealers, the affected jurisdictions may enter into a written agreement establishing a method of adjustment. If the agreement establishing a method of adjustment provides for payments of local communications services tax monthly distributions, the amount of any such payment agreed to may not exceed the local communications services tax monthly distributions available to the jurisdiction that was allocated amounts in excess of those to which it was entitled. If affected jurisdictions execute a written agreement specifying a method of adjustment, a copy of the written agreement shall be provided to the department no later than the first day of the month following 90 days after the date the department transmits notice of the misallocation. If the department does not receive a copy of the written agreement within the specified time period, an adjustment affecting a distribution to a jurisdiction made pursuant to this sub-subparagraph shall be prorated over a time period that equals the time period over which the misallocations occurred.</Text>
