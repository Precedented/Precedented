If the repeal under this act of a taxing authority’s authority to levy taxes or fees impairs security pledged to retire the authority’s bonded indebtedness secured by such taxes or fees, then to the extent of any such impairment, a like sum of revenue received by the authority under this act shall be deemed as a matter of law to replace said taxes and fees as security for the bonded indebtedness.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 54, 58, ch. 2000-260; s. 38, ch. 2001-140.</History></Section>
