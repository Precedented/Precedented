However, on and after that date, no water control district may be created except pursuant to s. 125.01 or a special act of the Legislature. Upon formation of a water control district by a special act of the Legislature, the circuit court of the county in which a majority of the land within the district is located shall thereafter maintain and have original and exclusive jurisdiction, coextensive with the boundaries and limits of the water control district without regard to county lines, for all purposes of this chapter.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 6458, 1913; RGS 1098; CGL 1451; s. 7, ch. 22858, 1945; ss. 25, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 1, ch. 72-291; s. 1, ch. 79-5; s. 17, ch. 79-65; s. 1, ch. 80-281.</History></Section>
