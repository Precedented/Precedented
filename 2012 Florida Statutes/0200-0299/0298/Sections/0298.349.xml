The assessment constitutes a lien upon the lands in the district from the effective date of the special act creating the district and must be collected by the district. If the board of supervisors determines that it is necessary to obtain funds to pay any expenses incurred or to be incurred in organizing the district, or any other expenses relating to the conduct and operation of the district, before a sufficient sum can be obtained by collecting the acreage assessment levied by this section, the board may borrow a sufficient sum of money for any of those purposes, may issue notes or bonds therefor, and may pledge any and all assessments of the initial acreage assessment levied under the provisions of this section for the repayment thereof. The board of supervisors may issue notes or bonds to any person or persons performing work or services or furnishing anything of value in the organization of the district or for any other expenses necessarily incurred before the receipt of funds arising from assessments or benefits.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 20, ch. 97-40.</History></Section>
