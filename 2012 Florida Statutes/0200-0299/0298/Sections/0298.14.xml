Such board shall adopt a seal with a suitable device; and it shall keep a record of all of its proceedings in a substantially bound book to be kept for that purpose, which shall be open to inspection by any interested person or the person’s agent or attorney. The board of supervisors shall report to the landowners, at the annual meeting held under the provisions of s. 298.12, of what work has been done, either by engineers or otherwise. The members of the board shall be reimbursed for their travel expenses pursuant to s. 112.061, but shall receive no compensation for their service unless the landowners at the annual meeting determine to pay a compensation, which in no event may exceed $50 per day for the time actually engaged in work for the district and in attending sessions of the board; however, if the secretary is a member of the board, he or she is entitled to compensation as provided in this chapter.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 6458, 1913; RGS 1104; CGL 1457; s. 11, ch. 63-400; s. 1, ch. 65-517; s. 1, ch. 83-170; s. 262, ch. 95-148.</History></Section>
