In such proceedings the jury shall deduct from the damages the benefits that will accrue to such intervening landowner by the construction of such ditch, and such intervening landowner shall have the right to use such ditch for the drainage of his or her own lands.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 50, ch. 6458, 1913; RGS 1147; CGL 1504; s. 23, ch. 79-5; s. 273, ch. 95-148.</History></Section>
