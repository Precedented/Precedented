			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This section contains optional provisions for military base reuse planning in recognition of the importance of ensuring prompt and effective planning for the conversion of military bases designated for closure by the Federal Government to maximize the welfare of impacted local governments and their constituents. While the reuse of these military bases shall provide substantial economic benefits to their host local governments, reuse activities may also have an adverse impact on the public facilities and services of local governments and impact resources and facilities of regional and statewide significance. The intent of this section is to address this unique relationship by providing for an optional military base reuse planning process that supersedes the provisions of chapter 380 pertaining to developments of regional impact and the requirements of part II of chapter 163, except as provided in this section.</Text>
