The Legislature further finds that these businesses could be assisted through the establishment of a Florida Export Finance Corporation designed to work with the United States Export-Import Bank, Small Business Administration, Foreign Credit Insurance Association, Overseas Private Investment Corporation, Private Export Funding Corporation, and other federal, state, and private agencies and institutions to provide Florida traders with information, technical assistance, and financial support. It is the intention of the Legislature to expand job opportunities for Florida’s workforce. Furthermore, it is the intention of the Legislature to avoid duplicating existing programs, and to coordinate, assist, augment, and improve the access to those programs by Florida-based small and medium-sized businesses and to promote Florida products and services in the international marketplace.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 47, ch. 93-187.</History></Section>
