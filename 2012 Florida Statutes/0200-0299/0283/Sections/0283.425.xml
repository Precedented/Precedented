If immediate necessity and lack of time to procure printing elsewhere compel the use of defective printing furnished by a contractor, it shall be accepted without approval, and one-half of the contract price thereon shall be deducted as liquidated damages for breach of contract. The agency which contracted for printing shall notify the contractor within a reasonable time after delivery of said printing as to acceptance or nonacceptance, and such reasonable time shall be specified in the contract. The contract shall also provide that a contractor has a reasonable time to correct any defects if delivery is made by a date specified in the contract, unless such a provision is not practicable because of time constraints.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 6, ch. 83-252; s. 4, ch. 88-32; ss. 8, 44, ch. 90-335.</History></Section>
