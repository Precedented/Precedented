Furthermore, construction shall proceed only upon disclosing to the department, for the facility chosen, the life-cycle costs as determined in s. 255.255, the facility’s sustainable building rating goal, and the capitalization of the initial construction costs of the building. The life-cycle costs and the sustainable building rating goal shall be primary considerations in the selection of a building design. For leased buildings more than 5,000 square feet in area within a given building boundary, an energy performance analysis consisting of a projection of the annual energy consumption costs in dollars per square foot of major energy-consuming equipment and systems based on actual expenses from the last 3 years and projected forward for the term of the proposed lease shall be performed. The lease shall only be made where there is a showing that the energy costs incurred by the state are minimal compared to available like facilities. A lease agreement for any building leased by the state from a private sector entity shall include provisions for monthly energy use data to be collected and submitted monthly to the department by the owner of the building.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">On and after January 1, 1979, no state agency shall initiate construction or have construction initiated, prior to approval thereof by the department, on a facility or self-contained unit of any facility, the design and construction of which incorporates or contemplates the use of an energy system other than a solar energy system when the life-cycle costs analysis prepared by the department has determined that a solar energy system is the most cost-efficient energy system for the facility or unit.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">After September 30, 1985, when any state agency must replace or supplement major items of energy-consuming equipment in existing state-owned or leased facilities or any self-contained unit of any facility with other major items of energy-consuming equipment, the selection of such items shall be made on the basis of a life-cycle cost analysis of alternatives in accordance with rules promulgated by the department under s. 255.255.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 74-187; s. 1, ch. 78-27; s. 4, ch. 85-256; s. 37, ch. 85-349; s. 15, ch. 98-279; s. 19, ch. 2008-227.</History></Section>
