If the indebtedness evidenced by any such principal obligation shall be in excess of the indebtedness evidenced by such collateral obligation or obligations, the exemption provided by this section shall not apply to the amount of such excess indebtedness; and, in such event, the excise taxes imposed by this chapter shall apply and be paid only in respect to such excess of indebtedness of such principal obligation. The term “collateral obligation” as used in this section means any note, bond, or other written obligation to pay money secured by mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien upon real or personal property. The pledging of a specific collateral obligation to secure a specific principal obligation, if required under the terms of the agreement, shall not invalidate the exemption provided by this section. The temporary removal of the document or documents representing one or more collateral obligations for a reasonable commercial purpose, for a period not exceeding 60 days, shall not invalidate the exemption provided by this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 29981, 1955; s. 8, ch. 79-350; s. 86, ch. 81-259.</History></Section>
