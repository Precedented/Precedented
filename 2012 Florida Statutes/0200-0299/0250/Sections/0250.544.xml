Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of the National Guard regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operations control of the Adjutant General of the state receiving assistance. Under no circumstances will the assisting member states use force within the boundaries of the other states without express federal authority. The assisting member states may assist in the support of a state using authorized police powers within its own boundaries but will not participate as part of the state police force without express federal authority. The assisting member state shall not be used to suppress riots or tumults or provide direct support to these activities without federal authority.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 93-283; s. 2, ch. 96-244.</History></Section>
