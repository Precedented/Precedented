The national military policy recognizes the Florida National Guard as an important component of the United States Army and Air Force, and a member of the total force, sharing in the defense of the country. The Florida National Guard is available to assist the state and local governments in the event of an emergency. Therefore, it is reasonable and equitable that the expense of maintaining the Florida National Guard be shared by the federal, state, and local governments. As the Federal Government is providing liberally for the equipment and training of the Florida National Guard and the state for its administration, management, and maintenance, local governments are encouraged to provide services at no cost to Florida National Guard armories.</Text><SubParagraph Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any contributions of money, any moneys derived from the rental of armories and other facilities, the armory-operations allowances provided in s. 250.20, and all money collected through fines imposed by a court-martial or nonjudicial proceeding of the Florida National Guard, as provided in s. 250.36(5), shall be received on behalf of the Armory Board by the post commander of such facility and must be deposited into a federal depository, approved by the Department of Military Affairs, in an account in a banking institution in the county in which such facility is located.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The funds received shall be disbursed for the purposes enumerated in this subsection at the discretion of the post commander according to rules established by the Armory Board.</Text></SubParagraph><SubParagraph Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any real property donated shall be held as other property for use by the state, and counties and municipalities may make donations of lands by deed or long-term lease and contributions of moneys for the purposes set forth in this section, and may issue bonds or certificates of indebtedness to provide funds for such purposes. Boards of county commissioners may levy taxes, not to exceed 1 mill, to provide funds for the construction of armories or for the retirement of bonds or certificates of indebtedness issued to provide funds for the construction of armories. Counties and municipalities may construct armories upon state-owned land, which may be made available for such purpose by action of the Armory Board. Counties and municipalities may also grant to the Armory Board, by deed or long-term leases, property that is acquired or buildings that are constructed for military purposes. Each local government is encouraged to provide economic incentives to reduce the cost of locating Florida National Guard facilities in its jurisdiction. A local government may appropriate funds to pay expenses of the Florida National Guard unit in its jurisdiction. Such funds will be received, accounted for, and dispersed as other funds received by the unit.</Text></SubParagraph></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Exercise the right of eminent domain to acquire private property for armories, buildings, and other facilities needed for military purposes, when in the public interest.

Any suit or action brought by the Armory Board to condemn property, as provided for under this section, shall be brought in the name of the Armory Board; and the Department of Legal Affairs shall conduct the proceedings for and act as the counsel of the board in such matters.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Accept and hold title to real property, by deed or long-term lease, from federal, state, or local governments, or from private interests, for use as armories or for other military purposes.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="f"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Adopt rules for managing armories and other facilities under the control of the Department of Military Affairs.
