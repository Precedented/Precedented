Such orders shall take effect whether any civil officer has issued a similar order; and the commanding officer of the troops may continue to enforce the prohibition until the departure of the troops, although the sheriff, mayor, or intendant of the county, city, town, or village may have prescribed an earlier or different date after which such selling, bartering, lending, or giving away may be carried on.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 36, ch. 8052, 1921; CGL 2048; s. 1, ch. 25112, 1949; s. 27, ch. 2003-68.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 250.42.</Text></Note></Section>
