Every endeavor consistent with the preservation of life and property must be made, both by the civil officers and officers commanding the troops, to induce rioters or persons lawlessly assembled to disperse before an attack is made upon them by which their lives may be endangered.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 34, ch. 8502, 1921; CGL 2046; s. 1, ch. 25112, 1949; s. 25, ch. 2003-68.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 250.40.</Text></Note></Section>
