				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An annuity equal to one one-hundred-fortieth of his or her average final compensation multiplied by the number of his or her years of membership in the case of each member electing to retire under the provisions of plan A or B.</Text>

With respect to plan A, B, C, or D, the employer shall not make any deduction for annuity purposes from the compensation of a member who has attained the age of 60 years, if such member elects not to contribute.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In determining the amount earnable by a member in a payroll period, the department may consider the rate of compensation payable to such member on the first day of the payroll period as continuing throughout such payroll period, and it may omit deductions from compensation for any period less than a full payroll period if a teacher was not a member on the first day of the payroll period, and to facilitate the making of deductions, it may modify any deduction required of any member by such an amount as shall not exceed one-tenth of 1 percent of the annual salary from which said deduction is to be made.</Text>

Such additional amounts so deposited shall become a part of his or her accumulated contributions, except that in the case of disability retirement they shall be treated as excess contributions returnable to the member in cash or as an annuity of equivalent actuarial value and shall not be considered in computing his or her pension.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="g">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A member who elects to retire under plan E shall pay to the Annuity Savings Trust Fund prior to retirement or receive from the Annuity Savings Trust Fund, as the case may be, the difference between what his or her contributions, with accumulated interest, would have been under plan E and the actual contributions of the member with accumulated interest.</Text>

Contributions to, and payments from, the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund, other than as set forth in subsections (2) and (3) herein, shall be made as follows:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">On account of each member there shall be paid annually into the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund, as provided for in s. 238.11, on account of the preceding year a certain percentage of his or her earnable compensation, to be known as the normal contribution, and an additional percentage of his or her earnable compensation, to be known as the accrued liability contribution. The rates percent of earnable compensation of such contributions shall be fixed on the basis of the liabilities of the retirement system, as shown by actuarial valuation.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">On the basis of regular interest and of such mortality and other tables as shall be adopted by the department, the actuary engaged by the department to make each valuation required by this chapter shall, during the period over which the accrued liability contribution is payable, determine, immediately after making such valuation, the uniform and constant percentage of the earnable compensation of the average new entrant, which, if contributed on the basis of his or her compensation throughout his or her entire period of service, would be sufficient to provide for the payment of any pension payable by the state on his or her account. The rate percent so determined shall be known as the normal contribution rate. After the accrued liability contribution has ceased to be payable, the normal contribution rate shall be the rate percent of the earnable compensation of all members, obtained by deducting from the total liabilities of the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund the amount of the funds in hand to the credit of that fund and dividing the remainder by 1 percent of the present value of the prospective future salaries of all members as computed on the basis of the mortality and service tables adopted by the department and on the basis of regular interest. The normal rate of contribution shall be determined and certified to the department by the actuary after each valuation and shall continue in force until a new valuation and certification are made.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Immediately succeeding the first valuation, the actuary engaged by the department shall compute the rate percent of the total earnable compensation of all members which is equivalent to 4 percent of the amount of the total liability for pensions on account of all members and beneficiaries and not dischargeable by the present assets of the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund and by the aforesaid normal contribution if made on account of such members during the remainder of their active service. The rate percent, originally so determined, shall be known as the accrued liability contribution rate.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The total amount payable in each year into the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall be not less than the sum of the rates percent known as the normal contribution rate and the accrued liability contribution rate, of the total earnable compensation of all members during the preceding year; provided, however that the amount of each annual accrued liability contribution shall be at least 3 percent greater than the preceding annual accrued liability contribution; and provided that the aggregate payment into the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall be sufficient, when combined with the amount then held in the fund, to provide the benefits payable from the fund during the current year.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="e">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The accrued liability contribution shall be discontinued as soon as the accumulated reserve in the Pension Accumulation Trust Fund shall equal the present value, as actuarially computed and approved by the department, of the total liability of such fund less the present value, computed on the basis of the normal contribution rate, then in force of the prospective normal contributions to be received on account of persons who are at that time members.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Expense Trust Fund shall be the fund to which shall be credited all moneys contributed for the administrative expenses of the retirement system and from which shall be paid all expenses incurred in connection with the administration and operation of the retirement system.
