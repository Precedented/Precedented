			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Economic Opportunity shall implement the 2006 Disaster Recovery Program from funds provided through the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Hurricane Recovery, 2006, for the purpose of assisting local governments in satisfying disaster recovery needs in the areas of low-income housing and infrastructure, with a primary focus on the hardening of single-family and multifamily housing units, not only to ensure that affordable housing can withstand the effects of hurricane-force winds, but also to mitigate the increasing costs of insurance, which may ultimately render existing affordable homes unaffordable or uninsurable. This section does not create an entitlement for local governments or property owners or obligate the state in any way to fund disaster recovery needs.</Text>
