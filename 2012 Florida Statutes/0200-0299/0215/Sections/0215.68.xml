Notice of such sale shall be provided at such time and shall contain such terms as the board shall deem advisable and proper under the circumstances; provided, that if no bids are received at the time and place called for by such notice of sale, or if all bids received are rejected, such bonds may again be offered for public sale by competitive bid or negotiated sale, as provided herein, upon a shorter period of reasonable notice provided for by resolution of the board. However, unless the State Constitution specifically requires the public sale by competitive bid of such bonds, the division may, by resolution adopted at a public meeting, determine that a negotiated sale of such bonds is in the best interest of the issuer, and may negotiate for sale of such bonds to any underwriter designated by the division.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">No bid conforming to the notice of sale may be rejected unless all bids are rejected.

The rights and remedies of the holders of such notes shall be the same rights and remedies which they would have if they were the holders of the definitive bonds in anticipation of which they are issued; and all of the covenants, agreements, or other proceedings relating to the definitive bonds in anticipation of which such bond anticipation notes are issued shall be a part of the proceedings relating to the issuance of such notes as fully and to the same extent as if incorporated verbatim therein.</Text>
