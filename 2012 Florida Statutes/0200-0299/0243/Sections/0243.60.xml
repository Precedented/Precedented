The authority may issue notes partly to renew notes or to discharge other obligations then outstanding and partly for any other purpose. The notes may be authorized, sold, executed, and delivered in the same manner as bonds. Any resolution authorizing notes of the authority or any issue thereof may contain any provisions that the authority is authorized to include in any resolution authorizing revenue bonds of the authority or any issue thereof, and the authority may include in any notes any terms, covenants, or conditions that it is authorized to include in any bonds. All the notes must be payable solely from the revenues of the project to be financed, subject only to any contractual rights of the holders of any of its notes or other obligations then outstanding.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 2001-79.</History></Section>
