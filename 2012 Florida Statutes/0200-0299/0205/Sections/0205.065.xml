Work or services performed in a place other than the county or municipality where the permanent business location or branch office is maintained may not be construed as creating a separate business location or branch office of that person for the purposes of this chapter. Any properly licensed contractor asserting an exemption under this section who is unlawfully required by the local governing authority to pay a business tax, or any registration or regulatory fee equivalent to a business tax, has standing to challenge the propriety of the local government’s actions, and the prevailing party in such a challenge is entitled to recover a reasonable attorney’s fee.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 32, ch. 92-203; s. 11, ch. 94-218; s. 1484, ch. 95-147; s. 6, ch. 99-254; s. 18, ch. 2006-152.</History></Section>
