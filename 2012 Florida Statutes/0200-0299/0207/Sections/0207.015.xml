The lien shall have priority over any lien or encumbrance whatsoever except the lien of other state taxes having priority by law, and except that the lien shall not be valid as against any bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor, or purchaser whose rights attached before the time when the department filed claim of lien in the office of the clerk of the circuit court of the county where the principal place of business of the person is located or, if the person has no principal place of business in the state, in the office of the Department of State, for which no filing fee shall be required. The lien shall continue until the amount of the tax, with any penalties and interest subsequently accruing, is paid or until the tax is barred under chapter 95. The department may issue a certificate of release of lien when the amount of the tax, with any penalties and interest subsequently accruing thereon, has been satisfied by the person; and the person may record it with the clerk of the circuit court of the county where the claim of lien was filed.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 80-415; s. 1, ch. 81-151.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 206.986.</Text></Note></Section>
