In the absence of adequate documentation by the motor carrier, the department is authorized to promulgate rules converting miles driven to gallons used.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purpose of computing the carrier’s liability for the road privilege tax, the total gallons of fuel used in the propulsion of any commercial motor vehicle in this state shall be multiplied by the rates provided in parts I, II, and IV of chapter 206. From the sum determined by this calculation, there shall be allowed a credit equal to the amount of the tax per gallon under parts I, II, and IV of chapter 206 for each gallon of fuel purchased in this state during the reporting period when the diesel fuel or motor fuel tax was paid at the time of purchase. If the tax paid under parts I, II, and IV of chapter 206 exceeds the total tax due under this chapter, the excess may be allowed as a credit against future tax payments, until the credit is fully offset or until eight calendar quarters shall have passed since the end of the calendar quarter in which the credit accrued, whichever occurs first. A refund may be made for this credit provided it exceeds $10.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department is authorized to promulgate the necessary rules to provide for an adequate bond from each motor carrier to ensure payment of taxes required under this chapter.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 80-415; s. 1, ch. 81-151; s. 103, ch. 81-259; s. 30, ch. 83-3; s. 12, ch. 83-138; s. 68, ch. 83-217; s. 3, ch. 84-260; s. 1, ch. 84-334; s. 4, ch. 84-353; s. 98, ch. 90-136; s. 6, ch. 90-329; s. 10, ch. 90-351; s. 2, ch. 94-306; s. 105, ch. 95-417.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 206.975.</Text></Note></Section>
