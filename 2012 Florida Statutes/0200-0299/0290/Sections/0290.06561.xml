		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding s. 290.0065(1), the Department of Economic Opportunity, upon request of the host county, shall designate as a rural enterprise zone any catalyst site as defined in s. 288.0656(2)(b) that was approved before January 1, 2010, and that is not located in an existing rural enterprise zone. The request from the host county must include the legal description of the catalyst site and the name and contact information for the county development authority responsible for managing the catalyst site. The designation shall provide businesses locating within the catalyst site the same eligibility for economic incentives and other benefits of a rural enterprise zone designated under s. 290.0065. The reporting criteria for a catalyst site designated as a rural enterprise zone under this section are the same as for other rural enterprise zones. Host county development authorities may enter into memoranda of agreement, as necessary, to coordinate their efforts to implement this section.</Text>
