In achieving this objective, the state will seek to provide appropriate investments, tax benefits, and regulatory relief of sufficient importance to encourage the business community to commit its financial participation. The purpose of ss. 290.001-290.016 is to establish a process that clearly identifies such severely distressed areas and provides incentives by both the state and local government to induce private investment in such areas. The Legislature, therefore, declares the revitalization of enterprise zones, through the concerted efforts of government and the private sector, to be a public purpose.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 82-119; ss. 44, 57, ch. 84-356; ss. 18, 37, ch. 94-136; s. 11, ch. 2005-287.</History><Note Reference="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Repealed December 31, 2015, by s. 11, ch. 2005-287.</Text></Note></Section>
