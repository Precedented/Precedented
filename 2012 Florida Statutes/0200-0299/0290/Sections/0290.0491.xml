			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">LEGISLATIVE INTENT.<EmDash />The Legislature recognizes that it is in the public interest that the state create economic opportunity in poverty-stricken areas and rebuild such areas by empowering the people and communities within these areas to create jobs and opportunities. The United States Congress in 1997 provided that an additional 20 areas may be designated as federal empowerment zones by January 1, 1999, and, as such, be eligible for federal funding under the Federal Empowerment Zone Program. The Legislature seeks to promote local governments in submitting the strongest possible proposals under the Federal Empowerment Zone Program by establishing a companion state empowerment zone program.</Text>
