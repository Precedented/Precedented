Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any other party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except those powers of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights, and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises and/or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises and/or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving states, whichever is longer.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 96-244.</History></Section>
