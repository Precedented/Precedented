Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency. This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources they may need in all types of emergencies or the capability of delivering resources to areas where emergencies exist.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The prompt, full, and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the Federal Government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care, and welfare of the people in the event of an emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 96-244.</History></Section>
