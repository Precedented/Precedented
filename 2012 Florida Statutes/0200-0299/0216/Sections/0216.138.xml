		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">A. Section 2, ch. 2010-101, provides that “[t]he Office of Economic and Demographic Research, acting in consultation with the principals of the consensus estimating conferences and after receiving public input, shall develop protocols and procedures necessary to implement the provisions of s. 216.138, Florida Statutes. At a minimum, the protocols and procedures to be used for evaluating specific proposed legislation shall include cost-benefit, return-on-investment, and dynamic scoring techniques, and may include additional, appropriate economic techniques. Additionally, the protocols and procedures must address the format for reporting results and provide proposed linkages to the appropriations and revenue forecasting processes, including any statutory changes that may be needed. The linkages must be consistent with the constitutional requirement for a balanced budget. The office shall submit a report of its findings and recommendations to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives by December 1, 2010. Subject to approval by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives following the submission of the report, the protocols and procedures shall be used to the extent feasible for the analysis of specific proposed legislation by consensus estimating conferences as provided in s. 216.138, Florida Statutes, unless and until such approval is subsequently affirmatively revoked.”</Text>
