It is the intent of the Legislature that all dollars within an agency or the judicial branch be allocated to the appropriate activity for budgeting purposes. Additionally, agencies or the judicial branch shall examine approved performance measures and recommend any changes so that outcomes are clearly delineated for each service or program, as appropriate, and outputs are aligned with activities. Output measures should be capable of being used to generate a unit cost for each activity resulting in a true accounting of what the state should spend on each activity it provides and what the state should expect to accomplish with those funds.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 9, ch. 2001-56.</History></Section>
