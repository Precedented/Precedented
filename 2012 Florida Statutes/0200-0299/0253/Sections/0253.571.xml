In the case of operations planned in the waters of the state or under other particular circumstances which, by their nature warrant greater security in view of possible damages, the board shall give special consideration to the extent of such possible damages and shall set the amount of an adequate and sufficient surety bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or other proof of financial responsibility accordingly. For the purposes of this section, damages shall include, but not be limited to, air, water, and ground pollution, destruction of wildlife or marine productivity and any other damage which impairs the health and general welfare of the citizens of the state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 69-367; ss. 27, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 1, ch. 89-358.</History></Section>
