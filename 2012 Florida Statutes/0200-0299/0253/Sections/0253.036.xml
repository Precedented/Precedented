		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">All land management plans described in s. 253.034(5) which are prepared for parcels larger than 1,000 acres shall contain an analysis of the multiple-use potential of the parcel, which analysis shall include the potential of the parcel to generate revenues to enhance the management of the parcel. The lead agency shall prepare the analysis, which shall contain a component or section prepared by a qualified professional forester which assesses the feasibility of managing timber resources on the parcel for resource conservation and revenue generation purposes through a stewardship ethic that embraces sustainable forest management practices if the lead management agency determines that the timber resource management is not in conflict with the primary management objectives of the parcel. For purposes of this section, practicing sustainable forest management means meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs by practicing a land stewardship ethic which integrates the reforestation, managing, growing, nurturing, and harvesting of trees for useful products with the conservation of soil, air and water quality, wildlife and fish habitat, and aesthetics. The Legislature intends that each lead management agency, whenever practicable and cost effective, use the services of the Florida Forest Service of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services or other qualified private sector professional forester in completing such feasibility assessments and implementing timber resource management. The Legislature further intends that the lead management agency develop a memorandum of agreement with the Florida Forest Service to provide for full reimbursement for any services provided for the feasibility assessments or timber resource management. All additional revenues generated through multiple-use management or compatible secondary use management shall be returned to the lead agency responsible for such management and shall be used to pay for management activities on all conservation, preservation, and recreation lands under the agency’s jurisdiction. In addition, such revenue shall be segregated in an agency trust fund and shall remain available to the agency in subsequent fiscal years to support land management appropriations.</Text>
