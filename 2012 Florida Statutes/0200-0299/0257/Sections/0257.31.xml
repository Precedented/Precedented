For the purposes of computing and apportioning state aid to interstate library districts hereinafter to be created, this state will consider that portion of the area which lies within this state as an independent entity for the performance of the aided function or functions and compute and apportion the aid accordingly. Subject to any applicable laws of this state, such a district also may apply for and be entitled to receive any federal aid for which it may be eligible.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 72-157.</History></Section>
