Those plans, which must include a component describing how the cooperative will share technology and the use of technology, must be submitted to the Division of Library and Information Services of the Department of State for evaluation and possible recommendation for funding in the division’s legislative budget request. Grant funds may not be used to supplant local funds or other funds. A library cooperative must provide from local sources matching cash funds equal to 10 percent of the grant award.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 92-110; s. 1, ch. 96-295.</History></Section>
