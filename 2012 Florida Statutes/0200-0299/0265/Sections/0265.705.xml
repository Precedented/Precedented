The destruction of these nonrenewable historical resources will engender a significant loss to the state’s quality of life, economy, and cultural environment. It is therefore declared to be state policy to provide leadership in the preservation of the state’s historical resources and to administer state-owned or state-controlled historical resources in a spirit of stewardship and trusteeship.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 2008-199.</History></Section>
