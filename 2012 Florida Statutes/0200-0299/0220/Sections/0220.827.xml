If such tax remains unpaid for 10 days after such demand has been made and no proceedings have been taken to review the same, the department may issue a warrant directed to any sheriff or other person authorized to serve process, commanding said sheriff or other person to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of the taxpayer found within his or her jurisdiction for the payment of the amount thereof, including penalties, interest, and the cost of executing the warrant. Such warrant shall be returned to the department together with the money collected by virtue thereof within the time therein specified, which shall not be less than 20 nor more than 90 days from the date of the warrant. The sheriff or other person to whom such a warrant shall be directed shall proceed upon the same in all respects and with like effect as is prescribed by law for executions issued against property upon judgments of record, and shall be entitled to the same fees for his or her services in executing the warrant, to be collected in the same manner. No proceedings for a levy under this section shall be commenced more than 20 years after the filing of the notice of lien under the provisions of this part.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Whenever an execution or writ of attachment issued from any court for the enforcement or collection of any tax liability created by this chapter shall be levied by any sheriff or other authorized person upon any personal property, and such property shall be claimed to be exempt from execution or attachment by any person other than the defendant in the execution or attachment, then it shall be the duty of the person making such claim to give notice in writing of his or her claim and of his or her intention to prosecute the same to the sheriff or other person within 10 days after the making of said levy. The giving of such notice shall be a condition precedent to any legal action against the sheriff or other authorized person for wrongful levy or seizure or for sale of said property, and any such person who fails to give notice within said time shall be forever barred from bringing any legal action against such sheriff or other person for injury or damages to or conversion of said property.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 19, ch. 71-359; s. 56, ch. 87-6; s. 33, ch. 87-101; s. 75, ch. 91-112; s. 1192, ch. 95-147.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 214.51.</Text></Note></Section>
