These areas and trails need not be generally suitable or maintained for normal travel by conventional two-wheel-drive vehicles and should not be designated as recreational footpaths. State off-highway vehicle recreation areas and trails must be selected and managed in accordance with this chapter.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">State agencies, water management districts, counties, and municipalities, and officers and employees thereof, which provide off-highway recreation areas and trails on publicly owned land are not liable for damage to personal property or personal injury or death to any person resulting from participation in the inherently dangerous risks of off-highway vehicle recreation. This subsection does not limit liability that would otherwise exist for an act of negligence by a state agency, water management district, county, or municipality, or officer or employee thereof, which is the proximate cause of the damage, injury, or death. Nothing in this subsection creates a duty of care or basis of liability for death, personal injury, or damage to personal property, nor shall anything in this subsection be deemed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity under any circumstances.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 53, ch. 2002-295; s. 3, ch. 2006-290.</History></Section>
