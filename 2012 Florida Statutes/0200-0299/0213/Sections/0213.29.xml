The filing of a protest based upon doubt as to liability or collection of a tax shall not be determined to be an attempt to evade tax under this section. The penalty imposed hereunder shall be in addition to any other penalty imposed or that should have been imposed under the revenue laws of this state, but shall be abated to the extent that the tax is paid. Any penalty may be compromised by the executive director of the Department of Revenue as set forth in s. 213.21. An assessment of penalty made pursuant to this section shall be deemed prima facie correct in any judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding brought to collect this penalty.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 46, ch. 85-342; s. 55, ch. 87-224; s. 104, ch. 90-136; s. 15, ch. 90-351; s. 21, ch. 92-320; s. 123, ch. 95-417.</History></Section>
