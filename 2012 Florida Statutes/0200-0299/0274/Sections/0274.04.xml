If, whenever acquiring property, the governmental unit may best serve the interests of the county or district by outright sale of the property to be replaced, rather than by exchange as a trade-in, it may make the sale in a manner otherwise prescribed in this act for the disposal of property. The receipts from the sale may be treated as a current refund if the property to be acquired shall be contracted for within the same fiscal year of the governmental unit in which the property sold is disposed of.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 59-163.</History></Section>
