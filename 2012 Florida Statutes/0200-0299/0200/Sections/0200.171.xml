The ability of the taxing unit involved to pay the taxes commanded to be levied shall be determined by the court within its sound discretion by the application of equitable considerations in view of all the conditions of the taxing unit bearing upon such ability to pay; and such ability to pay shall be first found and determined before the issuance of any such peremptory writ.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 18301, 1937; CGL 1940 Supp. 2321(3); ss. 1, 2, ch. 69-55.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 192.34.</Text></Note></Section>
