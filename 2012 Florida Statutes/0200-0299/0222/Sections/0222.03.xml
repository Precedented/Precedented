The person claiming the exemption shall not be forced to take as his or her homestead any tract or portion of a tract, if any defect exists in the title, except at the person’s option. The expense of such survey shall be chargeable on the execution as costs; but if it shall appear that the person claiming such exemption does not own more than 160 acres in the state, the expenses of said survey shall be paid by the person directing the same to be made.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 1715, 1869; s. 1, ch. 1944, 1873; RS 2000; GS 2522; RGS 3877; CGL 5784; s. 1197, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
