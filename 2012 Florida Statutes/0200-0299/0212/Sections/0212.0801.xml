The purchaser or lessee shall forward a copy of the written offer to the Department of Revenue. No exemption provided in this chapter for the lease, purchase, repair, or maintenance of a qualified aircraft shall be allowed unless the purchaser or lessee furnishes the dealer with a certificate stating that the lease, purchase, repair, or maintenance to be exempted is for the exclusive use of the purchaser or lessee of a qualified aircraft and that the purchaser or lessee otherwise qualifies for the exemption as provided in this section. If a purchaser or lessee makes tax-exempt purchases of qualified aircraft or leases a qualified aircraft on a continual basis, the purchaser or lessee may tender the certificate once and allow the dealer to keep a certificate on file. The purchaser or lessee shall inform the dealer that has a certificate on file when the purchaser or lessee no longer qualifies for the exemption. The department shall determine the format of the certificate.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 2006-144.</History></Section>
