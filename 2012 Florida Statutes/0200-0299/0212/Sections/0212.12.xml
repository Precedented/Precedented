However, if the amount of the tax due and remitted to the department by electronic means for the reporting period exceeds $1,200, an allowance is not allowed for all amounts in excess of $1,200.

					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The executive director of the department is authorized to negotiate a collection allowance, pursuant to rules promulgated by the department, with a dealer who makes mail order sales. The rules of the department shall provide guidelines for establishing the collection allowance based upon the dealer’s estimated costs of collecting the tax, the volume and value of the dealer’s mail order sales to purchasers in this state, and the administrative and legal costs and likelihood of achieving collection of the tax absent the cooperation of the dealer. However, in no event shall the collection allowance negotiated by the executive director exceed 10 percent of the tax remitted for a reporting period.</Text>

The department shall require that transient rentals and agricultural equipment transactions be separately shown. Sales made through vending machines as defined in s. 212.0515 must be separately shown on the return. Sales made through coin-operated amusement machines as defined by s. 212.02 and the number of machines operated must be separately shown on the return or on a form prescribed by the department.

If a dealer who makes such an election files a delinquent return, underpays the tax, or files an incomplete return, the amount transferred into the Educational Enhancement Trust Fund shall be the amount of the collection allowance remaining after resolution of liability for all of the tax, interest, and penalty due on that return or underpayment of tax. The Department of Education shall distribute the remaining amount from the trust fund to the school districts that have adopted resolutions stating that those funds will be used to ensure that up-to-date technology is purchased for the classrooms in the district and that teachers are trained in the use of that technology. Revenues collected in districts that do not adopt such a resolution shall be equally distributed to districts that have adopted such resolutions.</Text>

In order to conduct such a sample, the department must first make a good faith effort to reach an agreement with the dealer, which agreement provides for the means and methods to be used in the sampling process. In the event that no agreement is reached, the dealer is entitled to a review by the executive director. In the case of fixed assets, a dealer may agree in writing with the department for adequate but voluminous records to be statistically sampled. Such an agreement shall provide for the methodology to be used in the statistical sampling process. The audit findings derived therefrom shall be projected over the period represented by the sample in order to determine the proportion that taxable purchases bear to total purchases.

In the event the department determines from the sample results that the dealer has a net tax overpayment, the department shall provide the findings of this overpayment to the Chief Financial Officer for repayment of funds paid into the State Treasury through error pursuant to s. 215.26.</Text>

						<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A taxpayer is entitled, both in connection with an audit and in connection with an application for refund filed independently of any audit, to establish the amount of any refund or deficiency through statistical sampling when the taxpayer’s records are adequate but voluminous. In the case of fixed assets, a dealer may agree in writing with the department for adequate but voluminous records to be statistically sampled. Such an agreement shall provide for the methodology to be used in the statistical sampling process. The audit findings derived therefrom shall be projected over the period represented by the sample in order to determine the proportion that taxable purchases bear to total purchases.
