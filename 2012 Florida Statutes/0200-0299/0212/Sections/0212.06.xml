The manufacture or production of electrical power or energy that is used for space heating, lighting, office equipment, or air-conditioning or any other nonmanufacturing, nonprocessing, noncompounding, nonproducing, nonfabricating, or nonshipping activity is taxable. Electrical power or energy consumed or dissipated in the transmission or distribution of electrical power or energy for resale is also not taxable. Fabrication labor shall not be taxable when a person is using his or her own equipment and personnel, for his or her own account, as a producer, subproducer, or coproducer of a qualified motion picture.

Such cost price amount must be established as a percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number, of the total contract price charged for the improvement. The cost price percentages established must be adopted by rule pursuant to the procedures provided in s. 120.54, upon petition of a majority of the members of an industry group or by a statewide association that represents such industry group, and must be based on a reasonable estimate of average costs incurred by members of the petitioning industry group. The department is required to adopt a cost price percentage only if sufficient information is available to determine such percentage. The information considered by the department to establish the cost price percentage must be that set forth in the petition or that which is otherwise made available to the department. Any cost price percentage so established must be available only by election of a member of the industry group for which the percentage was established and may apply only to such periods or contracts for which the election is made. The election must be made by the taxpayer by timely accruing and remitting tax on the contract using the established percentage figure. If the taxpayer does not timely accrue and remit the use tax due for a contract using the percentage figure, the taxpayer may not later use this method of calculating the use tax due for that contract. Taxpayers must maintain adequate records showing the accrual of tax using the percentage figure on total contract price. Any cost price so established must remain available for use for a period of at least 5 years from the date of its adoption and must be reviewed and be subject to adjustment by the department no more frequently than at 5-year intervals.
