In the event said transportation company, agency, or firm refuses to permit such examination of its books, records, or other documents by the department as aforesaid, it is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. If, however, any subsequent offense involves intentional destruction of such records with an intent to evade payment of or deprive the state of any tax revenues, such subsequent offense shall be a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. The department shall have the right to proceed in any chancery court to seek a mandatory injunction or other appropriate remedy to enforce its right against the offender, as granted by this section, to require an examination of the books and records of such transportation company or carrier.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each dealer, as defined in this chapter, shall secure, maintain, and keep as long as required by s. 213.35 a complete record of tangible personal property or services received, used, sold at retail, distributed or stored, leased or rented by said dealer, together with invoices, bills of lading, gross receipts from such sales, and other pertinent records and papers as may be required by the department for the reasonable administration of this chapter; all such records which are located or maintained in this state shall be open for inspection by the department at all reasonable hours at such dealer’s store, sales office, general office, warehouse, or place of business located in this state. Any dealer who maintains such books and records at a point outside this state must make such books and records available for inspection by the department where the general records are kept. Any dealer subject to the provisions of this chapter who violates these provisions is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083. If, however, any subsequent offense involves intentional destruction of such records with an intent to evade payment of or deprive the state of any tax revenues, such subsequent offense shall be a felony of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purpose of enforcement of this chapter, every manufacturer and seller of tangible personal property or services licensed within this state is required to permit the department to examine his or her books and records at all reasonable hours, and, upon his or her refusal, the department may require him or her to permit such examination by resort to the circuit courts of this state, subject however to the right of removal of the cause to the judicial circuit wherein such person’s business is located or wherein such person’s books and records are kept, provided further that such person’s books and records are kept within the state. When the dealer has made an allocation or attribution pursuant to the definition of sales price in s. 212.02(16), the department may prescribe by rule the books and records that must be made available during an audit of the dealer’s books and records and examples of methods for determining the reasonableness thereof. Books and records kept in the regular course of business include, but are not limited to, general ledgers, price lists, cost records, customer billings, billing system reports, tariffs, and other regulatory filings and rules of regulatory authorities. Such record may be required to be made available to the department in an electronic format when so kept by the dealer. The dealer may support the allocation of charges with books and records kept in the regular course of business covering the dealer’s entire service area, including territories outside this state. During an audit, the department may reasonably require production of any additional books and records found necessary to assist in its determination.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the further purpose of enforcement of this chapter, every wholesaler of tangible personal property or services licensed within this state is required to permit the department to examine his or her books and records at all reasonable hours. He or she must also maintain such books and records as long as required by s. 213.35 in order to disclose the sales of all goods or services sold, to whom sold, and also the amount of items sold, in such form and in such manner as the department may reasonably require, so as to permit the department to determine the volume of goods or services sold by wholesalers to dealers, as defined under this chapter, and the dates and amounts of sales made. The department may require any manufacturer or wholesaler who refuses to keep such records or to permit such inspection, through the circuit courts of Florida, to submit to such inspection, subject however to the right of removal of the cause as hereinbefore provided in this section.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall send written notification at least 60 days prior to the date an auditor is scheduled to begin an audit, informing the taxpayer of the audit.
