The Legislature, in adopting this act, has recognized that the downtown area of the City of Tallahassee and the other area included in the district is, first and foremost, the Capitol Center of a great state and that the final authority for planning and development within the Capitol Center, whether public or private, should vest in the state. It is not the purpose of this act to acquire property or to prohibit private development, but rather to ensure that all development within the district, whether public or private, is consistent with the state concern for a well-planned, efficient and aesthetically attractive state capitol.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 72-13.</History></Section>
