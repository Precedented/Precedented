The Chief Financial Officer shall determine such assessment for each qualified public depository by multiplying the total amount of any remaining loss to all public depositors by a percentage which represents the average monthly balance of public deposits held by each qualified public depository during the previous 12 months divided by the total average monthly balances of public deposits held by all qualified public depositories, excluding the defaulting depository, during the same period.
