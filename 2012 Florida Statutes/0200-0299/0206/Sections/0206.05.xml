If such new bond is furnished as above provided, the department shall cancel and surrender the bond of the person for which such new bond is substituted.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In the event that the department decides that the amount of the existing bond is insufficient to ensure payment to the state of the amount of the tax and any penalties and interest for which the person is or may at any time become liable, then that person shall forthwith, upon the written demand of the department, file additional bond in the same manner and form with like security thereon as hereinbefore provided, and the department shall forthwith cancel the license of anyone failing to file an additional bond as herein provided.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any surety on any bond furnished by a person, as above provided, shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to the state accruing on such bond after the expiration of 60 days from the date upon which such surety has filed with the department written request to be released and discharged. However, such request shall not operate to relieve, release, or discharge such surety from any liability already accrued, or which shall accrue, before the expiration of the 60-day period. The department shall, promptly on receipt of notice of such request, notify the licensee who furnished the bond, and, unless the licensee on or before the expiration of the 60-day period files with the department a new bond with a surety company satisfactory to the department in the amount and form hereinbefore in this section provided, the department shall forthwith cancel the license.
