If such reimbursement is determined to adversely impact the toll facility or system, the reimbursement obligation shall become a debt payable to the State Transportation Trust Fund to be reimbursed over an agreed-upon period of time. The department shall take into account projections of operation and maintenance reimbursements in the financing of the tentative and adopted work programs. The state does hereby covenant that it will not repeal or impair or amend this section in any manner that will materially and adversely affect the rights of bondholders so long as bonds authorized pursuant to the provisions of this subsection are outstanding.</Text>
