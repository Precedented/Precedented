The Division of Risk Management within the Department of Financial Services shall adopt rules assessing the amount of such reimbursement for the actual costs of coverage associated with off-duty coverage and may adopt rules that provide for a deductible in an amount of not more than $500 per incident when the employee is determined to be at fault in the incident and was using the motor vehicle in approved activities for which he or she was liable to reimburse the state.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2004-83.</History></Section>
