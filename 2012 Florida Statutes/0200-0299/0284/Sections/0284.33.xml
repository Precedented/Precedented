However, the Department of Financial Services may directly purchase annuities by using a structured settlement insurance consulting firm selected by the department to assist in the settlement of claims being handled by the Division of Risk Management. The selection of the structured settlement insurance services consultant shall be made by using competitive sealed proposals. The consulting firm shall act as an agent of record for the department in procuring the best annuity products available to facilitate structured settlement of claims, considering price, insurer financial strength, and the best interests of the state risk management program. Purchase of annuities by the department using a structured settlement method is excepted from competitive sealed bidding or proposal requirements. The Department of Financial Services is further authorized to purchase such risk management services, including, but not limited to, risk and claims control; safety management; and legal, investigative, and adjustment services, as may be required and pay claims. The department may contract with a service organization for such services and advance money to such service organization for deposit in a special checking account for paying claims made against the state under the provisions of this part. The special checking account shall be maintained in this state in a bank or savings association organized under the laws of this state or of the United States. The department may replenish such account as often as necessary upon the presentation by the service organization of documentation for payments of claims equal to the amount of the requested reimbursement.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Nothing contained in chapter 287 shall be construed as requiring written agreements for health and mental health services or drugs in the examinations, diagnoses, or treatments of sick or injured employees or other benefits as required by the provisions of chapter 440.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 72-206; s. 90, ch. 73-333; s. 7, ch. 79-139; s. 4, ch. 83-159; s. 73, ch. 98-279; s. 1, ch. 2000-365; s. 319, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
