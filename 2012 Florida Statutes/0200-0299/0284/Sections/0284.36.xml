		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Premiums for coverage by the State Risk Management Trust Fund as calculated on all coverages shall be billed and charged to each state agency according to coverages obtained by the fund for their benefit, and such obligations shall be paid promptly by each agency from its operating budget upon presentation of a bill therefor. After the first year of operation, premiums to be charged to all departments of the state are to be computed on a retrospective rating arrangement based upon actual losses accruing to the fund and loss prevention results, taking into account reasonable expectations, the maintenance and stability of the fund, and the cost of insurance.</Text>
