The application shall also be accompanied by a corporate surety bond issued by a surety company authorized to do business in this state, conditioned for the payment when due of all taxes, penalties, and accrued interest which may be due the state. The bond shall be in the sum of $1,000 and in a form prescribed by the division. Whenever it is the opinion of the division that the bond given by a licensee is inadequate in amount to fully protect the state, the division shall require an additional bond in such amount as is deemed sufficient. A separate application for a license shall be made for each place of business at which a distributor proposes to engage in business as a distributor under this part, but an applicant may provide one bond in an amount determined by the division for all applications made by the distributor.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 85-141; s. 1, ch. 86-286; s. 4, ch. 91-429.</History></Section>
