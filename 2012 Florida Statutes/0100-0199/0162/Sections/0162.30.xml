The action shall be brought in county or circuit court, whichever is appropriate depending upon the relief sought. Counties and municipalities are authorized and required to pay any counsel appointed by the court to represent a private party in such action if the provision of counsel at public expense is required by the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of Florida and if the party is indigent as established pursuant to s. 27.52. The county or municipality shall bear all court fees and costs of any such action, and may, if it prevails, recover the court fees and costs and expense of the court-appointed counsel as part of its judgment. The state shall bear no expense of actions brought under this section except those that it would bear in an ordinary civil action between private parties in county court.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 87, ch. 2003-402.</History></Section>
