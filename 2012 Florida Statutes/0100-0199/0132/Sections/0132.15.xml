The unit may impose limitations on the right to exercise such option, and may provide that the option may only be exercised after a period of default, or by the holders of a certain amount or proportion of bonds, all as provided in the said resolution or in the refunding bonds, and if the right to the higher interest accrues may agree to substitute new bonds and coupons bearing such higher interest.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 15, ch. 15772, 1931; CGL 1936 Supp. 2383(15).</History></Section>
