The department may exempt interior tidal waters of the state from the permit requirements of this section.</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except during construction, such development may not interfere with the public use of any area of a beach seaward of the mean high-water line unless the department determines that the interference is unavoidable for purposes of protecting the beach or an endangered upland structure.

The width of such alternate access may not be required to exceed the width of the access that will be obstructed as a result of the permit being granted.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except for the deepwater ports identified in s. 403.021(9)(b), the department shall not issue a permit for the construction of a coastal inlet jetty or the excavation or maintenance of such an inlet if the activity authorized by the permit will have a significant adverse impact on the sandy beaches of this state without a mitigation program approved by the department.

A detailed review of a previously permitted project is not required if there have been no substantial changes in project scope and past performance of the project indicates that the project has performed according to design expectations. The department shall amend chapters 62B-41 and 62B-49, Florida Administrative Code, to streamline the permitting process for periodic beach maintenance projects and inlet sand bypassing activities.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="9"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Joint coastal permits issued for activities falling under this section and part IV of chapter 373 must allow for two maintenance or dredging disposal events or a permit life of 15 years, whichever is greater.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 65-408; ss. 25, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 2, ch. 78-257; s. 1, ch. 83-247; s. 12, ch. 87-97; s. 19, ch. 94-356; s. 3, ch. 2000-346; s. 2, ch. 2012-65; s. 2, ch. 2012-205.</History></Section>
