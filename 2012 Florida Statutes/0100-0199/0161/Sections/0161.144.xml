Therefore, the Department of Environmental Protection, pursuant to s. 161.161 and in cooperation with federal and local government agencies, shall develop and maintain an inventory of identified offshore sand sources as part of the regional elements of its comprehensive long-term beach management plan. Offshore sand sources in state or federal waters which are identified for potential, proposed, or permitted use shall be clearly mapped or otherwise noted and readily available for public review. In addition, boards of county commissioners of coastal counties adjacent to sand sources proposed for use outside of the region or subregion shall be provided written notice by the department and an opportunity to comment during a specific project’s planning and permitting stages. The department shall identify in its annual list of local government funding requests submitted to the Legislature, pursuant to s. 161.091, those projects that propose to use sand sources from another region or subregion at the time the list is submitted.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 2007-99.</History></Section>
