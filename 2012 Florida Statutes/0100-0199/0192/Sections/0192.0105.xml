The Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights compiles, in one document, brief but comprehensive statements that summarize the rights and obligations of the property appraisers, tax collectors, clerks of the court, local governing boards, the Department of Revenue, and taxpayers. Additional rights afforded to payors of taxes and assessments imposed under the revenue laws of this state are provided in s. 213.015. The rights afforded taxpayers to assure that their privacy and property are safeguarded and protected during tax levy, assessment, and collection are available only insofar as they are implemented in other parts of the Florida Statutes or rules of the Department of Revenue. The rights so guaranteed to state taxpayers in the Florida Statutes and the departmental rules include:</Text><Subsection Id="1"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">THE RIGHT TO KNOW.<EmDash /></Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The right to be sent a notice of proposed property taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments (see ss. 194.011(1), 200.065(2)(b) and (d) and (13)(a), and 200.069).
