The county shall have the right to enter into such leases or lease-purchase arrangements with private individuals, other governmental agencies, or corporations. When the term of such lease is for longer than 60 months, the rental shall be payable only from funds arising from sources other than ad valorem taxation. Such leases or lease-purchase arrangements shall be subject to approval by the board of county commissioners, and no such lease or lease-purchase contract shall be entered into without said approval. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a lease entered into by a county, as defined in s. 125.011(1), with the state or another governmental entity or authorized under the provisions of s. 125.01 is not subject to the 30-year lease term limitation of this section.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 71-240; s. 1, ch. 89-103; s. 1, ch. 2008-48.</History></Section>
