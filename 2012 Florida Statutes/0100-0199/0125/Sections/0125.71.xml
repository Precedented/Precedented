It is the further legislative intent to provide a formula and structure for the economic and efficient conduct of county affairs by making the county administrator established by this act responsible for handling of all things necessary to accomplish and bring to fruition the policies established by the board of county commissioners.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 74-193.</History></Section>
