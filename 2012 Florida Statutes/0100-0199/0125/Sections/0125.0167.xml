For purposes of this section, the term “housing” is not limited to single-family, detached dwellings. The rate of the surtax shall not exceed the rate of 45 cents for each $100 or fractional part thereof of the consideration therefor. Such surtax shall apply only to those documents taxable under s. 201.02, except that there shall be no surtax on any document pursuant to which the interest granted, assigned, transferred, or conveyed involves only a single-family residence.
