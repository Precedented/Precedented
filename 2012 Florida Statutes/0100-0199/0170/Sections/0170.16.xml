The assessment roll as finally approved and confirmed shall be competent and sufficient evidence that the assessment was duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to the adoption of the assessment roll were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this chapter, and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby. However, nothing in this section shall relieve the governing authority from notifying the affected property owners of the special assessments as required by this chapter.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 16, ch. 9298, 1923; CGL 3037; s. 7, ch. 87-103; s. 41, ch. 91-45.</History></Section>
