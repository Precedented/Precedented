Thereafter, the municipality or special fire control district shall be prohibited from participating under this chapter, and shall not be eligible for future premium tax moneys. Premium tax moneys previously received shall continue to be used for the sole and exclusive benefit of firefighters, or firefighters and police officers where included, and no amendment, legislative act, ordinance, or resolution shall be adopted which shall have the effect of reducing the then-vested accrued benefits of the firefighters, retirees, or their beneficiaries. The municipality or special fire control district shall continue to furnish an annual report to the division as provided in s. 175.261. If the municipality or special fire control district subsequently terminates the defined benefit plan, they shall do so in compliance with the provisions of s. 175.361.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 81, ch. 99-1.</History></Section>
