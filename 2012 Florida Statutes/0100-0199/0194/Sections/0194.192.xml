If it finds that the amount of tax which the taxpayer has admitted to be owing is grossly disproportionate to the amount of tax found to be due and that the taxpayer’s admission was not made in good faith, the court shall also assess a penalty at the rate of 10 percent of the deficiency per year from the date the tax became delinquent.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 8, ch. 69-140; s. 33, ch. 70-243; s. 35, ch. 71-355; s. 2, ch. 72-239; s. 18, ch. 82-226; s. 4, ch. 96-397.</History></Section>
