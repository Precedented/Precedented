		<Subsection Id="1">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In any administrative or judicial action in which a taxpayer challenges an ad valorem tax assessment of value, the property appraiser’s assessment is presumed correct if the appraiser proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessment was arrived at by complying with s. 193.011, any other applicable statutory requirements relating to classified use values or assessment caps, and professionally accepted appraisal practices, including mass appraisal standards, if appropriate. However, a taxpayer who challenges an assessment is entitled to a determination by the value adjustment board or court of the appropriateness of the appraisal methodology used in making the assessment. The value of property must be determined by an appraisal methodology that complies with the criteria of s. 193.011 and professionally accepted appraisal practices. The provisions of this subsection preempt any prior case law that is inconsistent with this subsection.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the challenge is to the assessed value of the property, the party initiating the challenge has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the assessed value:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Does not represent the just value of the property after taking into account any applicable limits on annual increases in the value of the property;</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Does not represent the classified use value or fractional value of the property if the property is required to be assessed based on its character or use; or</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="3">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Is arbitrarily based on appraisal practices that are different from the appraisal practices generally applied by the property appraiser to comparable property within the same county.</Text>

			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the party challenging the assessment satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a), the presumption provided in subsection (1) is overcome, and the value adjustment board or the court shall establish the assessment if there is competent, substantial evidence of value in the record which cumulatively meets the criteria of s. 193.011 and professionally accepted appraisal practices. If the record lacks such evidence, the matter must be remanded to the property appraiser with appropriate directions from the value adjustment board or the court, and the property appraiser must comply with those directions.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the challenge is to the classification or exemption status of the property, there is no presumption of correctness, and the party initiating the challenge has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the classification or exempt status assigned to the property is incorrect.</Text>
