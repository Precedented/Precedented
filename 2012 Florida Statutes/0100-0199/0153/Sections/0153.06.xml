Prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, the county may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary bonds with or without coupons exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The county commission may also provide for the replacement of any bonds which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this chapter without obtaining the consent of any commission, board, bureau or agency of the state and without the proceeding or happening of any other condition or thing than those proceedings, conditions or things which are specifically required by this chapter.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of costs of the water supply system or systems or the water system improvements or the sewage disposal system or systems or the sewer improvements, for the purchase, construction or reconstruction of which such bonds shall have been authorized, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the county commission may provide in the authorizing resolution.

If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the purpose for which such bonds shall have been issued, the surplus shall be paid into the fund provided under the provisions of this chapter for the payment of principal of and the interest on such bonds.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 6, ch. 29837, 1955; s. 5, ch. 67-547; ss. 3, 4, ch. 73-302; s. 4, ch. 80-98; s. 864, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
