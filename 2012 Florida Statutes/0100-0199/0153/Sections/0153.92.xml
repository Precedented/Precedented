A public entity entering into a wastewater facility privatization contract may make such conveyances of its property, and may make such other agreements and perform such other acts consistent with law, as are determined by the public entity to be necessary or convenient to effectuate the wastewater facility privatization contract. It is the intent of the Legislature that the language used in this section is intended to clarify the existing authority rather than provide any additional authority for public entities to enter into wastewater facility privatization contracts.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 96-202.</History></Section>
