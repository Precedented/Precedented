The principal of and interest on any such bonds shall be payable from the rates, fees, charges or other revenues derived from the operation of any such system or systems in the manner provided in this law and the resolution authorizing such revenue bonds and pledging such revenues. Such revenue bonds may also be additionally secured by the pledge of special assessments levied pursuant to this law, or by a pledge of the full faith and credit of said district. The revenue bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates as shall not exceed 7.5 percent per annum, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates as may be determined by the district board and may be made redeemable before maturity, at the option of the district board, under such terms and conditions and at such prices as may be fixed by the district board prior to the issuance of such bonds. The district board shall determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or without the state.

In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature shall appear on the bonds shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such bonds, such signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery. All revenue bonds issued under the provisions of this law shall be and constitute and have all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments under the law merchant and the negotiable instruments law of the state. The bonds may be issued in coupon or registered form as the district board may determine in such authorizing resolution and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to principal alone and also as to principal and interest, and for the reconversion of coupon bonds or of any bond registered as to principal and interest. The issuance of such bonds shall not be subject to any limitations or conditions contained in any other law and the district board may sell such bonds in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price, as it may determine to be for the best interests of the district, but no such sale shall be made at a price so low as to require the payment of interest on money received therefor at a rate in excess of 7.5 percent per annum, computed with relation to the absolute maturity of the bonds in accordance with standard tables of bond values, excluding, however, from such computation the amount of any premium to be paid for the redemption of any bonds prior to maturity.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The proceeds of the sale of any such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the costs of the construction or acquisition of any water system or sewer system or both or the reconstruction or construction or acquisition of extensions, improvements and additions thereto, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, as the district board may provide in the authorizing resolution. Prior to the preparation or issuance of definitive revenue bonds, the district board may, under like restrictions, issue interim receipts or temporary notes or other form of such temporary obligations without coupons, exchangeable for definitive bonds when such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery.
