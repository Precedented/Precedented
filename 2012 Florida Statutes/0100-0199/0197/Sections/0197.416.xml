		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">It is the duty of the tax collector issuing a tax warrant for the collection of delinquent tangible personal property taxes to continue his or her efforts to collect such taxes for 7 years after the date of the ratification of the warrant. After the expiration of 7 years, the warrant is barred by this statute of limitation. A tax collector or his or her successor is not relieved of accountability for collection of any taxes assessed on tangible personal property until he or she has completely performed every duty devolving upon the tax collector as required by law.</Text>
