		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When it appears that it will be impossible for the property appraiser to certify the tax roll for collection in time sufficient to allow payment of current taxes prior to January 1, the property appraiser shall certify such circumstances in writing to the tax collector on or before December 1 and shall provide to the collector a true copy of the preceding year’s tax roll as certified for collection and a statement of current year’s millages from taxing authorities which have so certified. The property appraiser’s certification shall constitute authority for the collector to receive payments of estimated taxes.</Text>
		</Subsection>
		<Subsection Id="3">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Immediately upon receipt of the property appraiser’s certification under subsection (2), the tax collector shall publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county that the tax roll will not be certified for collection before January 1 and that payments of estimated taxes may be made by taxpayers who submit payment to the collector on or before December 31.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="5">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When estimated taxes are paid, the collector shall issue a validated temporary tax notice-receipt.

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Second, any excess remaining shall be distributed pro rata to the taxing authorities in the proportion that each authority’s tax levy for the prior tax year bears to the total ad valorem tax levy for the prior tax year; however, a taxing authority which has requested and received an emergency distribution of estimated taxes shall not receive this distribution.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon receipt of the tax roll certified for collection, the tax collector shall prepare a tax notice-receipt for each taxpayer who has made payment of estimated taxes, showing the amount of estimated taxes paid and the taxes remaining unpaid or any overpayment. Each such tax notice-receipt shall show the periods in which discounts are authorized, the amount of discount, and the discount applied to the estimated taxes with the appropriate remainder due.</Text>
