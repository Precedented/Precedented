			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If there is a change in use or ownership of tax-deferred property such that the owner is no longer eligible for the tax deferral granted, or the owner fails to maintain the required fire and extended insurance coverage, the total amount of deferred taxes and interest for all years is due and payable November 1 of the year in which the change occurs or on the date failure to maintain insurance occurs. Payment is delinquent on April 1 of the year following the year in which the change in use or failure to maintain insurance occurs. However, if the change in ownership is to a surviving spouse and the spouse is eligible to maintain the tax deferral on such property, the surviving spouse may continue the deferment of previously deferred taxes and interest pursuant to this chapter.</Text>
