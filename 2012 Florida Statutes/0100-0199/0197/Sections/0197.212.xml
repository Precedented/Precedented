		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">On the recommendation of the county tax collector, the board of county commissioners may adopt a resolution instructing the collector not to mail tax notices to a taxpayer if the amount of taxes shown on the tax notice is less than an amount up to $30. The resolution shall also instruct the property appraiser that he or she may not make an extension on the tax roll for any parcel for which the tax would amount to less than an amount up to $30. The minimum tax bill so established may not exceed an amount up to $30. This section does not apply to a parcel of property that is subject to an adverse possession claim pursuant to s. 95.18.</Text>
