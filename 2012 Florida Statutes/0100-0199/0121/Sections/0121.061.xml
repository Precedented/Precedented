			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The appropriations provided each state agency, beginning with the 1970-1971 fiscal year and each fiscal year thereafter, shall include sufficient amounts to pay the matching contributions for social security and retirement as required by this chapter. No state agency, whether its funds are provided by state appropriations or otherwise, shall employ any person or maintain any person on its payroll unless it has allotted for such person sufficient funds to meet these required payments. Should a state agency fail to make such payments, the administrator shall report same to the Governor and certify the amount due the system trust funds to the Executive Office of the Governor. If arrangements cannot be made for the state agency to pay said amount due, then the amount due is hereby appropriated and shall be paid from the General Revenue Fund of the state.</Text>
