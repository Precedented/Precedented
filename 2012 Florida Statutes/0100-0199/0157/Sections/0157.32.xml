If no such complaints are filed in writing on the first day of the meeting of the board the assessments shall stand confirmed. If complaints are filed, the board shall hear and determine the same, and, if allowed, may modify or change the former assessments so as to equitably spread the burden on the property specially benefited.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 6963, 1915; RGS 1770; CGL 2821.</History></Section>
