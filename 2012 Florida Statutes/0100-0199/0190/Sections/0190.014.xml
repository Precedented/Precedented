Such notes shall be in such denomination or denominations, bear interest at such rate as the board may determine in compliance with s. 215.84, mature at such time or times not later than 5 years from the date of issuance, and be in such form and executed in such manner as the board shall prescribe. Such notes may be sold at either public or private sale or, if such notes shall be renewal notes, may be exchanged for notes then outstanding on such terms as the board shall determine. Such notes shall be paid from the proceeds of such bonds when issued. The board may, in its discretion, in lieu of retiring the notes by means of bonds, retire them by means of current revenues or from any taxes or assessments levied for the payment of such bonds; but in such event a like amount of the bonds authorized shall not be issued. Non-ad valorem assessments levied to pay interest on bond anticipation notes shall not constitute an installment of assessments under s. 190.022.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 80-407; s. 9, ch. 83-215; s. 9, ch. 2007-160.</History></Section>
