To establish an equitable division of the costs, the amount to be paid by each agency shall be determined in such proportion as the service rendered to each agency bears to the total service rendered under the provisions of this chapter. The amounts paid to the Department of Management Services which are attributable to positions within the Senior Management Service and the Selected Professional Service shall be used for the administration of such services, training activities for positions within those services, and the development and implementation of a database of pertinent historical information on exempt positions. Should any state agency become more than 90 days delinquent in payment of this obligation, the department shall certify to the Chief Financial Officer the amount due and the Chief Financial Officer shall transfer the amount due to the department from any debtor agency funds available.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 20, ch. 79-190; s. 1, ch. 85-318; s. 24, ch. 92-279; s. 55, ch. 92-326; s. 119, ch. 2003-261.</History></Section>
