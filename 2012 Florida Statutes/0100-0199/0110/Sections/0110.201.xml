Agencies must comply with the uniform rules, except as provided in this section. The department may adopt rules that provide alternative requirements. Upon filing with the Department of State, the appropriate uniform rules will constitute the personnel rules for each agency subject to this act unless the Administration Commission grants an exception to a specific rule to an agency upon the agency’s request or unless the agency must comply with a statutory provision that conflicts with the uniform rules. If an agency must comply with a statutory provision that conflicts with the uniform rules, the agency must notify the Administration Commission, the Administrative Procedures Committee, and the appropriate standing committees of the Legislature and advise the standing committees whether the agency recommends revision of the statute to conform it to the uniform rules. Agencies are encouraged to propose methods of conforming statutory provisions to the uniform personnel rules.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">An agency may request an exception to the uniform personnel rules by filing a petition with the Administration Commission. The Administration Commission shall approve an exception when the exception is necessary to conform to any requirement imposed as a condition precedent to receipt of federal funds or to permit persons in this state to receive tax benefits under federal law, or as required for the most efficient operation of the agency as determined by the Administration Commission. The reasons for the exception must be published in the Florida Administrative Weekly.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Agency rules that provide exceptions to the uniform personnel rules may not be filed with the Department of State unless the Administration Commission has approved the exceptions. Each agency that adopts rules that provide exceptions to the uniform rules or that must comply with statutory requirements that conflict with the uniform rules must have a separate chapter published in the Florida Administrative Code which clearly delineates the provisions of the agency’s rules which provide exceptions or are based upon a conflicting statutory requirement. Each alternative chosen from those authorized by the uniform rules must be specified. Each chapter must be organized in the same manner as the uniform rules.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall develop uniform forms and instructions to be used in reporting transactions which involve changes in an employee’s salary, status, performance, leave, fingerprint record, loyalty oath, payroll change, appointment action, or any additional transactions as the department may determine appropriate.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">It is the responsibility of the employing agency to maintain these records and all other records and reports prescribed in applicable rules on a current basis.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each employing agency shall operate within the uniform personnel rules promulgated by the department under this chapter. Any rule adopted by an employing agency that is an exception to the uniform personnel rules or that is based upon a statutory provision that an agency must follow but which conflicts with the uniform personnel rules may not prescribe any personnel policies inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter. Neither the rules of the department nor the rules of an employing agency may include any benefits for career service employees which are in excess of, or in addition to, those authorized by this chapter.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The rules adopted by the department and each employing agency under this part shall comply with all federal regulations necessary to permit the state agencies to be eligible to receive federal funds.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall coordinate with the Governor and consult with the Administration Commission on personnel matters falling within the scope of collective bargaining and shall represent the Governor in collective bargaining negotiations and other collective bargaining matters as may be necessary.
