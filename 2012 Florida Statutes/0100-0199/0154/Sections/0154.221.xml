Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds may pledge or assign the fees, rents, charges, or proceeds from the sale of any project or part thereof, insurance proceeds, condemnation awards, and other funds and revenues to be received therefor, and may provide for the mortgaging of any project or any part thereof as security for repayment of the bonds. Such trust agreement or resolution providing for the issuance of such bonds shall contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the authority in relation to the acquisition of property and the construction, improvement, maintenance, repair, operation, and insurance of the project or projects in connection with which such bonds shall have been authorized; the fees, rents and other charges to be fixed and collected; the sale of any project, or part thereof, or other property; the terms and conditions for the issuance of additional bonds; and the custody, safeguarding, and application of all moneys. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the state which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds, revenues, or other money hereunder to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the authority. Any such trust agreement or resolution shall set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee and may restrict the individual right of action by bondholders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the authority may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the bondholders. All expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of the project or projects in connection with which bonds are issued or as an expense of administration of such projects, as the case may be.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 11, ch. 74-323.</History></Section>
