Notwithstanding any other law, the authority may sell or lease property of the authority in a transaction in which the authority leases the property back from its purchaser or lessee. To facilitate the development of a project by an authority, any governmental entity or other unit of local government may sell or lease its property to an authority upon a negotiated basis, without competitive bid, and for no or nominal consideration, and an authority may resell or sublease or grant an operating agreement for the property to a professional sports franchise in the same manner.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 13, ch. 2000-348.</History></Section>
