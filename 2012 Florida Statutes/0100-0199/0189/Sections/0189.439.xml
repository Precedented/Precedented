Any provisions regarding the details or terms of any bonds that are required or permitted to be set forth in a resolution of the board may be set forth in a trust agreement with the same effect as if the provisions were set forth in a resolution of the board.

It is lawful for any bank or trust company within or outside the state to act as a depository of the proceeds of bonds or of revenues and to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as are required by the authority. The resolution or trust agreement may set forth the rights and remedies of the bondholders and of the trustee, if any, and may restrict the individual rights of action by bondholders. The board may provide for the payment of proceeds of the sale of the bonds and the revenues of any project to any officer, board, or depository that it designates for the custody thereof and may provide for the method of disbursement thereof with such safeguards and restrictions as it establishes.
