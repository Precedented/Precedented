If any bonds or other obligations of the authority are outstanding, any act of the Legislature dissolving the authority shall set forth the proposed arrangements under which holders of the outstanding obligations will be immediately paid or will continue to be paid, which arrangements must be consistent with the terms of the outstanding obligations.
