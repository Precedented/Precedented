Each contractor doing business with the authority and required to be licensed by the state or local general-purpose governments must maintain the license during the term of the contract with the authority. The authority may prescribe bid security requirements and other procedures in connection with the award of contracts which protect the public interest. The authority may, and in the case of a new professional sports franchise must, by written contract engage the services of the operator, lessee, sublessee, or purchaser, or prospective operator, lessee, sublessee, or purchaser, of any project in the construction of the project and may, and in the case of a new professional sports franchise must, provide in the contract that the lessee, sublessee, purchaser, or prospective lessee, sublessee, or purchaser, may act as an agent of, or an independent contractor for, the authority for the performance of the functions described therein, subject to the conditions and requirements prescribed in the contract, including functions such as the acquisition of the site and other real property for the project; the preparation of plans, specifications, financing, and contract documents; the award of construction and other contracts upon a competitive or negotiated basis; the construction of the project, or any part thereof, directly by the lessee, purchaser, or prospective lessee or purchaser; the inspection and supervision of construction; the employment of engineers, architects, builders, and other contractors; and the provision of money to pay the cost thereof pending reimbursement by the authority. Any such contract may, and in the case of a new professional sports franchise must, allow the authority to make advances to or reimburse the lessee, sublessee, or purchaser, or prospective lessee, sublessee, or purchaser for its costs incurred in the performance of those functions, and must set forth the supporting documents required to be submitted to the authority and the reviews, examinations, and audits that are required in connection therewith to assure compliance with the contract.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 12, ch. 2000-348; s. 59, ch. 2002-20.</History></Section>
