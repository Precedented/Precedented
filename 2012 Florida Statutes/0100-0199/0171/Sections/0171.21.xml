A local government within a county that has adopted a charter provision pursuant to s. 171.044(4) may avail itself of the provisions of this part which authorize an interlocal service boundary agreement if such interlocal agreement is consistent with the charter of that county, as the charter was approved, revised, or amended pursuant to s. 125.64.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 2006-218.</History></Section>
