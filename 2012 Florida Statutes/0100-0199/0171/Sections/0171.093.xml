In addition, the municipality may incorporate its election into the annexation ordinance.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Upon a municipality’s election to assume the district’s responsibilities, the municipality and the district may enter into an interlocal agreement addressing the orderly transfer of service responsibilities, real assets, equipment, and personnel to the municipality. The agreement shall address allocation of responsibility for special district services, avoidance of double taxation of property owners for such services in the area of overlapping jurisdiction, prevention of loss of any district revenues which may be detrimental to the continued operations of the independent district, avoidance of impairment of existing district contracts, disposition of property and equipment of the independent district and any assumption of indebtedness for it, the status and employee rights of any adversely affected employees of the independent district, and any other matter reasonably related to the transfer of responsibilities.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the municipality and the district are unable to enter into an interlocal agreement pursuant to subsection (3), the municipality shall so advise the district and the property appraiser and tax collector of the county in which the annexed property is located and, effective October 1 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the municipality declares its intent to assume service responsibilities in the annexed area, the district shall remain the service provider in the annexed area for a period of 4 years. During the 4-year period, the municipality shall pay the district an amount equal to the ad valorem taxes or assessments that would have been collected had the property remained in the district.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">By the end of the 4-year period, or any extension mutually agreed upon by the district and the municipality, the municipality and the district shall enter into an agreement that identifies the existing district property located in the municipality or primarily serving the municipality that will be assumed by the municipality, the fair market value of such property, and the manner of transfer of such property and any associated indebtedness. If the municipality and district are unable to agree to an equitable distribution of the district’s property and indebtedness, the matter shall proceed to circuit court. In equitably distributing the district’s property and associated indebtedness, the taxes and other revenues paid the district by or on behalf of the residents of the annexed area shall be taken into consideration.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">During the 4-year period, or during any mutually agreed upon extension, district service and capital expenditures within the annexed area shall continue to be rationally related to the annexed area’s service needs.

Nothing in this section precludes the contraction of the boundary of any independent special district by special act of the Legislature. The district shall not levy ad valorem taxes or assessments on the annexed property in the calendar year in which its boundaries contract and subsequent years, but it may continue to collect and use all ad valorem taxes and assessments levied in prior years. Nothing in this section prohibits the district from assessing user charges and impact fees within the annexed area while it remains the service provider.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">In addition to any other authority provided by law, a municipality is authorized to levy assessments on property located in an annexed area to offset all or a portion of the costs incurred by the municipality in assuming district responsibilities pursuant to this section.
