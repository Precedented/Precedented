		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">This chapter provides uniform procedures for the exercise of specified authority. This chapter does not limit or impinge upon the assignment of executive power under Article IV of the State Constitution or the legal authority of an appointing authority to direct and supervise those appointees serving at the pleasure of the appointing authority. For purposes of this chapter, adherence to the direction and supervision of an appointing authority does not constitute delegation or transfer of statutory authority assigned to the appointee.</Text>

		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Section 3, ch. 2012-116, provides that “[t]he Legislature intends that the amendments made by this act to ss. 20.02, 20.03, and 20.05, Florida Statutes, which apply to the organizational structure of the executive branch, and the creation of s. 120.515, Florida Statutes, which applies to administrative procedure, are to clarify that the placement of an executive department under the direct administration of an officer or board appointed by and serving at the pleasure of the Governor does not implicitly limit or restrict the Governor’s prerogative, legal authority, and constitutional responsibility to direct and supervise the execution of the law and the exercise of lawful discretion.”</Text>
