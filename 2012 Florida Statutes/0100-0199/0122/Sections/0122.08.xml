The amount of such reduced retirement compensation shall be the actuarial equivalent of the amount of such retirement compensation otherwise payable to such officer or employee. Any state or county officer or employee who becomes eligible for retirement and continues to hold office or be employed shall be construed to have selected the option herein which will afford the surviving spouse the greatest amount of benefits. Should such officer or employee die before retiring, his or her surviving spouse shall be entitled to receive either the accumulated contributions of such officer or employee at the date of death or the reduced retirement compensation to which the surviving spouse would have been entitled under such option, calculated on the assumption that such officer or employee retired on the date of death; provided, that for all those persons who become members of the retirement system on or after July 1, 1963, the amount of retirement compensation otherwise payable to the member at the date of death shall be determined on the basis of a retirement age of 62 years. Any officer or employee shall have the right at the time of retirement to change the option so provided; and, should the option be changed or not at the time of retirement, such option shall be effective immediately upon retirement and thereafter may not be revoked.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A member who elects an option in paragraph (a) shall on a form provided for that purpose designate his or her spouse as beneficiary to receive the benefits which continue to be payable upon the death of the member.

If such a retired member remarries and wishes to make such a change, he or she may do so by filing with the department a notarized change of spouse designation form and shall notify the former spouse in writing of such change. Upon receipt of a completed change of spouse designation form, the department shall adjust the member’s monthly benefit by the application of actuarial tables and calculations developed to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the member’s current benefit. The consent of a retired member’s formerly designated spouse as beneficiary to any such change shall not be required.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Tables for computing the actuarial equivalent shall be approved by the department.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any person retiring under the disability provision of this chapter shall not be entitled to the options of subsection (4).</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="7"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">No state or county official or employee who has a shortage in his or her accounts may retire or receive any benefits under this chapter so long as such shortage exists.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="8"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any member of the retirement system whose rights have been preserved under s. 122.01(3) and who has had 30 years of service may exercise the option provided for in subsection (4) as it applies to persons who are eligible for normal retirement benefits.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="9"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to any officer or employee who has accumulated at least 10 years of service and dies:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the deceased member’s surviving spouse has previously received a refund of the member’s contributions made to the retirement trust fund, such spouse may pay to the department an amount equal to the sum of the amount of the deceased member’s contributions previously refunded and interest at 3 percent compounded annually on the amount of such refunded contributions from the date of refund until July 1, 1975, and thereafter at the rate of 6.5 percent interest compounded annually to the date of payment to the department, and by so doing be entitled to receive the monthly retirement benefit provided in paragraph (c).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the deceased member’s surviving spouse has not received a refund of the deceased member’s contributions, such spouse shall, upon application to the department, receive the monthly retirement benefit provided in paragraph (c).</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The monthly benefit payable to the spouse described in paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) shall be the amount which would have been payable to the deceased member’s spouse, assuming that the member retired on the date of death and had selected the option in subsection (4) which would afford the surviving spouse the greatest amount of benefits, such benefit to be based on the ages of the spouse and member as of the date of death of the member.
