Any state agency may maintain a dual numbering system in which the federal employer’s identification number or the state agency’s own number is the primary identification number; however, the records of such state agency shall be designed in such a way that the record of any business entity is subject to direct location by the federal employer’s identification number. The Department of State shall keep a registry of federal employer’s identification numbers of all business entities, registered with the Division of Corporations, which registry of numbers may be used by all state agencies.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-148.</History></Section>
