Nevertheless, on or before June 1 of every year after the effective date of this act, the electric utilities with service areas within each regional planning council shall notify the regional planning council of the utilities’ current plans over a 5-year period to site electric substations within the local governments contained within each region, including an identification of whether each electric substation planned within a general area is a distribution or transmission electric substation, a listing of the proposed substations’ site acreage needs and anticipated capacity, and maps showing general locations of the planned electric substations. This information is advisory, shall be included in the regional planning council’s annual report prepared pursuant to s. 186.513, and shall be supplied directly to local governments requesting the information.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 2006-268.</History></Section>
