It is, further, the legislative intent that municipalities shall continue to exercise all powers heretofore conferred on municipalities by the chapters enumerated above, but shall hereafter exercise those powers at their own discretion, subject only to the terms and conditions which they choose to prescribe.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Nothing contained in s. 5, chapter 73-129, Laws of Florida, shall be interpreted to impair any claim against a municipality or to affect the validity of any bonds or obligations issued under authority of any of the chapters enumerated in subsection (1).</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 5, ch. 73-129.</History></Section>
