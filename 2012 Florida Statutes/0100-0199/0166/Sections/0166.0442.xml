The ordinance must require each person applying for, or continuing employment in, any such position or having access to any such facility to be fingerprinted. The fingerprints shall be submitted to the Department of Law Enforcement for a state criminal history record check and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history record check. The information obtained from the criminal history record checks conducted pursuant to the ordinance may be used by the municipality to determine an applicant’s eligibility for employment or appointment and to determine an employee’s eligibility for continued employment. This section is not intended to preempt or prevent any other background screening, including, but not limited to, criminal history background checks, that a municipality may lawfully undertake.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2002-169.</History></Section>
