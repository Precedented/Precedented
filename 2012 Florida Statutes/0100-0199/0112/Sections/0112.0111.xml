			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Legislature declares that a goal of this state is to clearly identify the occupations from which ex-offenders are disqualified based on the nature of their offenses. The Legislature seeks to make employment opportunities available to ex-offenders in a manner that serves to preserve and protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public, yet encourages them to become productive members of society. To this end, state agencies that exercise regulatory authority are in the best position to identify all restrictions on employment imposed by the agencies or by boards that regulate professions and occupations and are obligated to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public by clearly setting forth those restrictions in keeping with standards and protections determined by the agencies to be in the least restrictive manner.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each state agency, including, but not limited to, those state agencies responsible for professional and occupational regulatory boards, shall ensure the appropriate restrictions necessary to protect the overall health, safety, and welfare of the general public are in place, and by December 31, 2011, and every 4 years thereafter, submit to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives a report that includes:</Text>
			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A list of all agency or board statutes or rules that disqualify from employment or licensure persons who have been convicted of a crime and have completed any incarceration and restitution to which they have been sentenced for such crime.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A determination of whether the disqualifying statutes or rules are readily available to prospective employers and licensees.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The identification and evaluation of alternatives to the disqualifying statutes or rules which protect the health, safety, and welfare of the general public without impeding the gainful employment of ex-offenders.</Text>
