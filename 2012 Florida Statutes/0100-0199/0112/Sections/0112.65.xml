			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">ESTABLISHMENT OF PROGRAM.<EmDash />The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of any retirement system or plan and who has not previously participated in such plan, on or after January 1, 1980, may not exceed 100 percent of his or her average final compensation. However, this section does not apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. For the purposes of this section, benefits accruing in individual member accounts established under the investment plan established in part II of chapter 121 are considered supplemental benefits. As used in this section, the term “average final compensation” means the average of the member’s earnings over a period of time which the governmental entity has established by statute, charter, or ordinance.</Text>

This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under chapter 67, Title 10, United States Code.</Text>

		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">“(1) Effective upon this act becoming a law, the State Board of Administration and the Department of Management Services shall request, as soon as practicable, a determination letter and private letter ruling from the United States Internal Revenue Service. If the United States Internal Revenue Service refuses to act upon a request for a private letter ruling, then a legal opinion from a qualified tax attorney or firm may be substituted for such private letter ruling.</Text>

Upon receipt of such notice, the state board and the department shall notify the presiding officers of the Legislature.”</Text>
