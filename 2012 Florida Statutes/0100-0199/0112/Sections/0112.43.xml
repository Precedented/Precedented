Should the Senate, or the select committee appointed by the Senate to hear the evidence and to make recommendations, desire private counsel, either the Senate or the select committee shall be entitled to employ its own counsel for this purpose. Nothing herein shall prevent the Senate or its select committee from making its own investigation and presenting such evidence as its investigation may reveal. The Governor may request the advice of the Department of Legal Affairs relative to the suspension order prior to its issuance by the Governor. Following the issuance of the suspension order, either the Senate or the select committee may request the Department of Legal Affairs to provide counsel for the Senate to advise on questions of law or otherwise advise with the Senate or the select committee, but the Department of Legal Affairs shall not be required to prosecute before the Senate or the committee and shall, pursuant to the terms of this section, act as the legal adviser only.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 4, ch. 69-277; s. 33, ch. 77-104; s. 712, ch. 95-147; s. 61, ch. 2004-11.</History></Section>
