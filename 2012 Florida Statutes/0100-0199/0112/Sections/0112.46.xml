It is the intent of this part to provide that the formal execution of a commission by the Governor and a delivery thereof to the officer is a ministerial duty not necessary either to the performance of the duties of that officer or to the susceptibility to suspension of that officer. However, nothing in this part shall prohibit or preclude any officer claiming title to any office from seeking a judicial determination of his or her right to such office, regardless of the issuance or nonissuance of a commission to such office.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 7, ch. 69-277; s. 715, ch. 95-147.</History></Section>
