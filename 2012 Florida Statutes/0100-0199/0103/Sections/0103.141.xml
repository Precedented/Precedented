		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If the county executive committee by at least a two-thirds majority vote of the members of the committee, attending a meeting held after due notice has been given and at which meeting a quorum is present, determines an incumbent county executive committee member is guilty of an offense involving a violation of the member’s oath of office, the member shall be removed from office and the office shall be deemed vacant. However, if the county committee wrongfully removes a county committee member and the committee member wrongfully removed files suit in the circuit court alleging his or her removal was wrongful and wins the suit, the committee member shall be restored to office and the county committee shall pay the costs incurred by the wrongfully removed committee member in bringing the suit, including reasonable attorney’s fees.</Text>
