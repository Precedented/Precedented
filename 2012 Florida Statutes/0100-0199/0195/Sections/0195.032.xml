The standard measures of value shall provide guidelines for the valuation of property and methods for property appraisers to employ in arriving at the just valuation of particular types of property consistent with ss. 193.011 and 193.461. The standard measures of value shall assist the property appraiser in the valuation of property and be deemed prima facie correct, but shall not be deemed to establish the just value of any property. However, the presumption of correctness accorded an assessment made by a property appraiser shall not be impugned merely because the standard measures of value do not establish the just value of any property.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 38, ch. 70-243; s. 12, ch. 76-133; s. 9, ch. 76-234; s. 62, ch. 82-226.</History></Section>
