If applicable, the affidavit must state that the professional surveyor and mapper or legal entity has made a resurvey of the subject property in the recorded subdivision within the last 10 days and that no evidence existed on the ground that would conflict with the corrections as stated in the affidavit. The affidavit shall describe the nature and extent of such error or omission and the appropriate correction that in the affiant’s professional opinion should be substituted for the erroneous data shown on the plat or added to the data on the plat. When such an affidavit is filed, it is the duty of the circuit court clerk to record the affidavit, and he or she must place in the margin of the recorded plat a notation that the affidavit has been filed, the date of filing, and the official book and page where it is recorded. The notation must also be placed on all copies of the plat used for reproduction purposes. The affidavit shall have no effect upon the validity of the plat.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 71-339; s. 7, ch. 82-179; s. 105, ch. 94-119; s. 1455, ch. 95-147; s. 13, ch. 98-20.</History></Section>
