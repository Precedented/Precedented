All such monuments and evidence pertaining to the original government surveys and resurveys are recognized as historical and economic resources of the state and, as such, are vitally important to the orderly planning, management, use, conservation, and public enjoyment of Florida’s natural resources. In order to implement this policy, the department shall assume the responsibility for conducting a program of the identification, restoration, and preservation of such monuments.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 77-361; s. 77, ch. 81-259; s. 37, ch. 94-356.</History></Section>
