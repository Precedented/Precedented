This line represents the intersection of the mean high-water datum with the outer limits of vegetation and appears to the navigator as the shoreline.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Comparison of simultaneous observations” means a method of determining mean values by comparison of short-period observations at a station with simultaneous observations made at a station for which mean values, based on long-period observations, are available.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Control tide station” means a place so designated by the department or the National Ocean Service at which continuous tidal observations have been taken or are to be taken over a minimum of 19 years to obtain basic tidal data for the locality.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="4"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Datum” means a reference point, line, or plane used as a basis for measurements.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">“Datum plane” means a surface used as reference from which heights or depths are reckoned.
