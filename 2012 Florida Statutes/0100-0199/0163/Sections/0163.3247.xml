			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">FINDINGS AND INTENT.<EmDash />The Legislature finds and declares that the population of this state is expected to more than double over the next 100 years, with commensurate impacts to the state’s natural resources and public infrastructure. Consequently, it is in the best interests of the people of the state to ensure sound planning for the proper placement of this growth and protection of the state’s land, water, and other natural resources since such resources are essential to our collective quality of life and a strong economy. The state’s growth management system should foster economic stability through regional solutions and strategies, urban renewal and infill, and the continued viability of agricultural economies, while allowing for rural economic development and protecting the unique characteristics of rural areas, and should reduce the complexity of the regulatory process while carrying out the intent of the laws and encouraging greater citizen participation.</Text>
