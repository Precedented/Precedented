If the department is satisfied that no tax liability exists or that the tax liability of an estate has been fully discharged or provided for, it may issue a waiver releasing any or all property of such estate from the lien herein imposed.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 15, ch. 16015, 1933; CGL 1936 Supp. 1342(95); s. 1, ch. 57-108; s. 13, ch. 59-1; ss. 21, 35, ch. 69-106; s. 4, ch. 77-411.</History></Section>
