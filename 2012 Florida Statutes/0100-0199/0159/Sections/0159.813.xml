The authority granted to the Governor under this section may be exercised for allocation of any volume limitation imposed by any enacted or proposed federal law or regulation upon bonds authorized to be issued in this state. If such executive order is issued, the division shall notify the President of the Senate and Minority Leader of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives and Minority Leader of the House of Representatives in writing of such an order and the reasons such order was issued, within 10 days of the issuance of the order. Any such order shall remain effective until this part is amended to be consistent with federal law or the regulations issued thereunder. If any such order is issued based upon proposed amendments or successor provisions to the Code, the allocation system provided in this part and the system provided under any such order shall be administered concurrent with one another, to the extent feasible, as long as may be required due to the pendency of any proposed amendments or successor provisions to the Code.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 85-282; s. 11, ch. 86-181; s. 10, ch. 87-222.</History></Section>
