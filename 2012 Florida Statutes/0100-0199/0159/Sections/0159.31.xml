The local agency shall not be required to pay any taxes on any project or any other property owned by the local agency under the provisions of this part or upon the income therefrom. The bonds issued under the provisions of this part, their transfer, and the income therefrom (including any profit made on the sale thereof), and all notes, mortgages, security agreements, letters of credit, or other instruments which arise out of or are given to secure the repayment of bonds issued in connection with a project financed under this part, shall at all times be free from taxation by the state or any local unit, political subdivision, or other instrumentality of the state.
