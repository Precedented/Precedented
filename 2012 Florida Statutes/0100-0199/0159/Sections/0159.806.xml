In issuing such written confirmations, the division must first use the allocation pool for the region in which the agency issuing such bonds or on whose behalf such bonds are being issued is located, except prior to June 1, when the state allocation pool or the Florida First Business allocation pool must be used to finance priority projects until such allocation is exhausted. Unless otherwise agreed to by the affected agencies, when such bonds are to be issued by an agency whose boundaries include more than one region, the division must first issue an allocation from the allocation pool for the region in which the project is to be located.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Except as provided in subsection (1), no portion of a regional allocation pool may be used by an agency in another region.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 1, ch. 85-282; s. 5, ch. 87-222; s. 4, ch. 92-127; s. 4, ch. 2000-353.</History></Section>
