Such instrument shall be promptly recorded in the same manner as any other instrument affecting the title to real property. Upon obtaining the approval of the board for release, the property will be subject to a deferred tax liability. The release shall be made to the owner upon payment of the deferred tax liability. Any payment of the deferred tax liability shall be payable to the county tax collector within 90 days of the date of approval of the release by the board. The tax collector shall distribute the payment to each governmental unit in the proportion that its millage bears to the total millage levied on the parcel for the years in which the covenant was in effect.</Text>
