If the property appraiser adjusts upward the reduced values previously determined by the value adjustment board, the property appraiser shall assert additional basic and underlying facts not properly considered by the value adjustment board as the basis for the increased valuation notwithstanding the prior adjustment by the board.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 2, ch. 2000-262.</History></Section>
