Such property which is situated in this state shall be subject to the taxes exempted thereby, plus a penalty of 50 percent of the unpaid taxes for each year and 15 percent interest per annum. However, if a homestead exemption is improperly granted as a result of a clerical mistake or an omission by the property appraiser, the person improperly receiving the exemption shall not be assessed penalty and interest. Before any such lien may be filed, the owner so notified must be given 30 days to pay the taxes, penalties, and interest.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The collection of the taxes provided in this section shall be in the same manner as existing ad valorem taxes, and the above procedure of recapturing such taxes shall be supplemental to any existing provision under the laws of this state.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The lien herein provided shall not attach to the property until the notice of tax lien is filed among the public records of the county where the property is located. Prior to the filing of such notice of lien, any purchaser for value of the subject property shall take free and clear of such lien. Such lien when filed shall attach to any property which is identified in the notice of lien and is owned by the person who illegally or improperly received the homestead exemption. Should such person no longer own property in the county, but own property in some other county or counties in the state, it shall be the duty of the property appraiser to record a notice of tax lien in such other county or counties, identifying the property owned by such person in such county or counties, and it shall become a lien against such property in such county or counties.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">ss. 1, 2, 3, 4, ch. 67-134; ss. 1, 2, ch. 69-55; s. 20, ch. 69-216; s. 1, ch. 74-155; s. 1, ch. 77-102; s. 12, ch. 81-219; s. 51, ch. 82-226; s. 10, ch. 86-300; s. 4, ch. 90-343; s. 40, ch. 94-353; s. 1, ch. 95-359; s. 10, ch. 2002-18.</History><Note><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Former s. 192.215.</Text></Note></Section>
