		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Any candidate, political committee, committee of continuous existence, electioneering communication organization, affiliated party committee, or state or county executive committee of a political party may authorize or conduct a political poll, survey, index, or measurement of any kind relating to candidacy for public office so long as the candidate, political committee, committee of continuous existence, electioneering communication organization, affiliated party committee, or political party maintains complete jurisdiction over the poll in all its aspects. State and county executive committees of a political party or an affiliated party committee may authorize and conduct political polls for the purpose of determining the viability of potential candidates. Such poll results may be shared with potential candidates, and expenditures incurred by state and county executive committees or an affiliated party committee for potential candidate polls are not contributions to the potential candidates.</Text>
