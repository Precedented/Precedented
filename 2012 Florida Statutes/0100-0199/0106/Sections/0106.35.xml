				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each candidate who has been certified to receive contributions from the <Reference Number="1" />Election Campaign Financing Trust Fund shall be entitled to distribution of funds as follows:</Text>
				<SubParagraph Id="1">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For qualifying matching contributions making up all or any portion of the threshold amounts specified in s. 106.33(2), distribution shall be on a two-to-one basis.</Text>

				<SubParagraph Id="2">
					<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For all other qualifying matching contributions, distribution shall be on a one-to-one basis.</Text>
				</SubParagraph>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Qualifying matching contributions are those of $250 or less from an individual, made after September 1 of the calendar year prior to the election. Any contribution received from an individual who is not a state resident at the time the contribution is made shall not be considered a qualifying matching contribution. For purposes of this paragraph, any person validly registered to vote in this state shall be considered a state resident. Aggregate contributions from an individual in excess of $250 will be matched only up to $250. A contribution from an individual, if made by check, must be drawn on the personal bank account of the individual making the contribution, as opposed to any form of business account, regardless of whether the business account is for a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, trust, or other form of business arrangement. For contributions made by check from a personal joint account, the match shall only be for the individual who actually signs the check.</Text>
