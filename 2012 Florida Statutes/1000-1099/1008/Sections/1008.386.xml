Each school district shall use social security numbers as student identification numbers in the management information system maintained by the school district. However, a student is not required to provide his or her social security number as a condition for enrollment or graduation. A student satisfies this requirement by presenting to school enrollment officials his or her social security card or a copy of the card. The school district shall include the social security number in the student’s permanent records and shall indicate if the student identification number is not a social security number. The Commissioner of Education shall provide assistance to school districts to assure that the assignment of student identification numbers other than social security numbers is kept to a minimum and to avoid duplication of any student identification number.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 385, ch. 2002-387.</History></Section>
