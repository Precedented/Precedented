The Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability (OPPAGA) and the Office of the Auditor General are directed to develop a system for reviewing the financial management practices of school districts. In this system, the Auditor General shall assist OPPAGA in examining district operations to determine whether they meet “best financial management practices.”</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The best financial management practices adopted by the Commissioner of Education may be updated periodically after consultation with the Legislature, the Governor, the Department of Education, school districts, and the Auditor General. OPPAGA shall submit to the Commissioner of Education for review and adoption proposed revisions to the best financial management practices adopted by the commissioner. The best financial management practices, at a minimum, must instill public confidence by addressing the school district’s use of resources, identifying ways that the district could save funds, and improving districts’ performance accountability systems, including public accountability. To achieve these objectives, best practices shall be developed for, but need not be limited to, the following areas:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Management structures.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Performance accountability.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Efficient delivery of educational services, including instructional materials.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Administrative and instructional technology.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Personnel systems and benefits management.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="f"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Facilities construction.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="g"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Facilities maintenance.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="h"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Student transportation.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="i"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Food service operations.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="j"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Cost control systems, including asset management, risk management, financial management, purchasing, internal auditing, and financial auditing.</Text></Paragraph><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">In areas for which the commissioner has not adopted best practices, OPPAGA may develop additional best financial management practices, with input from a broad range of stakeholders. OPPAGA shall present any additional best practices to the commissioner for review and adoption.

At least one member of the private firm review team shall have expertise in school district finance. The scope of the review shall focus on the best practices adopted by the Commissioner of Education, pursuant to subsection (2).
