			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each elected district school superintendent shall receive a base salary, the amounts indicated in this subsection, based on the population of the county the elected superintendent serves. In addition, compensation shall be made for population increments over the minimum for each population group, which shall be determined by multiplying the population in excess of the minimum for the group times the group rate. The product of such calculation shall be added to the base salary to determine the adjusted base salary. Laws that increase the base salary provided in this subsection shall contain provisions on no other subject.</Text>
