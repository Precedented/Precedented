For purposes of any vote of the district school board chair and district school board members acting in any capacity, action taken pursuant to that side of a tie vote on which the district school board chair voted satisfies the requirement that action be taken by a “majority” vote or a “simple majority” vote. This section applies only to those counties organized by charter that have a population of between 800,000 and 900,000 according to the last federal decennial census.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 3, ch. 2006-256.</History></Section>
