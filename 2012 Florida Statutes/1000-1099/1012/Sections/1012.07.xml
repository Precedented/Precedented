		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The term “critical teacher shortage area” means high-need content areas and high-priority location areas identified by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall adopt rules pursuant to ss. 120.536(1) and 120.54 necessary to annually identify critical teacher shortage areas. The state board must consider current and emerging educational requirements and workforce demands in determining critical teacher shortage areas. School grade levels may also be designated critical teacher shortage areas. Individual district school boards may identify and submit other critical teacher shortage areas. Such submissions must be aligned to current and emerging educational requirements and workforce demands in order to be approved by the State Board of Education. High-priority location areas shall be in high-density, low-economic urban schools; low-density, low-economic rural schools; and schools that earned a grade of “F” or three consecutive grades of “D” pursuant to s. 1008.34.</Text>
