		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each Florida College System institution board of trustees may purchase annuities for its Florida College System institution personnel who have 25 or more years of creditable service and who have reached age 55 and have applied for retirement under the Florida Retirement System. No such annuity may provide for more than the total difference in retirement income between the retirement benefit based on average monthly compensation and creditable service as of the member’s early retirement date and the early retirement benefit. Florida College System institution boards of trustees may also purchase annuities for members of the Florida Retirement System who have out-of-state teaching service in another state or country which is documented as valid by the appropriate educational entity. Such annuities may be based on no more than 5 years of out-of-state teaching service and may equal, but not exceed, the benefits that would be payable under the Florida Retirement System if credit for out-of-state teaching was authorized under that system. Each Florida College System institution board of trustees may invest funds, purchase annuities, or provide local supplemental retirement programs for purposes of providing retirement annuities for Florida College System institution personnel. All such retirement annuities shall comply with s. 14, Art. X of the State Constitution.</Text>
