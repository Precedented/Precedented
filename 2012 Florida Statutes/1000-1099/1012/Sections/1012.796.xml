			<Paragraph Id="a">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Education shall cause to be investigated expeditiously any complaint filed before it or otherwise called to its attention which, if legally sufficient, contains grounds for the revocation or suspension of a certificate or any other appropriate penalty as set forth in subsection (7). The complaint is legally sufficient if it contains the ultimate facts which show a violation has occurred as provided in s. 1012.795 and defined by rule of the State Board of Education. The department shall investigate or continue to investigate and take appropriate action on a complaint even though the original complainant withdraws the complaint or otherwise indicates a desire not to cause it to be investigated or prosecuted to completion. The department may investigate or continue to investigate and take action on a complaint filed against a person whose educator certificate has expired if the act or acts that are the basis for the complaint were allegedly committed while that person possessed an educator certificate.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The department shall immediately investigate any legally sufficient complaint that involves misconduct by any certificated personnel which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student, giving the complaint priority over other pending complaints. The department must investigate or continue to investigate and take action on such a complaint filed against a person whose educator certificate has expired if the act or acts that are the basis for the complaint were allegedly committed while that person possessed an educator certificate.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">When an investigation is undertaken, the department shall notify the certificateholder or applicant for certification and the district school superintendent or the university laboratory school, charter school, or private school in which the certificateholder or applicant for certification is employed or was employed at the time the alleged offense occurred. In addition, the department shall inform the certificateholder or applicant for certification of the substance of any complaint which has been filed against that certificateholder or applicant, unless the department determines that such notification would be detrimental to the investigation, in which case the department may withhold notification.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each school district shall file in writing with the department all legally sufficient complaints within 30 days after the date on which subject matter of the complaint comes to the attention of the school district. A complaint is legally sufficient if it contains ultimate facts that show a violation has occurred as provided in s. 1012.795 and defined by rule of the State Board of Education. The school district shall include all information relating to the complaint which is known to the school district at the time of filing. Each district school board shall develop and adopt policies and procedures to comply with this reporting requirement. School board policies and procedures must include standards for screening, hiring, and terminating instructional personnel and school administrators, as defined in s. 1012.01; standards of ethical conduct for instructional personnel and school administrators; the duties of instructional personnel and school administrators for upholding the standards; detailed procedures for reporting alleged misconduct by instructional personnel and school administrators which affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student; requirements for the reassignment of instructional personnel or school administrators pending the outcome of a misconduct investigation; and penalties for failing to comply with s. 1001.51 or s. 1012.795. The district school board policies and procedures shall include appropriate penalties for all personnel of the district school board for nonreporting and procedures for promptly informing the district school superintendent of each legally sufficient complaint. The district school superintendent is charged with knowledge of these policies and procedures and is accountable for the training of all instructional personnel and school administrators of the school district on the standards of ethical conduct, policies, and procedures. If the district school superintendent has knowledge of a legally sufficient complaint and does not report the complaint, or fails to enforce the policies and procedures of the district school board, and fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection, in addition to other actions against certificateholders authorized by law, the district school superintendent is subject to penalties as specified in s. 1001.51(12). If the superintendent determines that misconduct by instructional personnel or school administrators who hold an educator certificate affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student and the misconduct warrants termination, the instructional personnel or school administrators may resign or be terminated, and the superintendent must report the misconduct to the department in the format prescribed by the department. The department shall maintain each report of misconduct as a public record in the instructional personnel’s or school administrators’ certification files. This paragraph does not limit or restrict the power and duty of the department to investigate complaints, regardless of the school district’s untimely filing, or failure to file, complaints and followup reports.</Text>

				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">If allegations arise against an employee who is certified under s. 1012.56 and employed in an educator-certificated position in any public school, charter school or governing board thereof, or private school that accepts scholarship students under s. 1002.39 or s. 1002.395, the school shall file in writing with the department a legally sufficient complaint within 30 days after the date on which the subject matter of the complaint came to the attention of the school. A complaint is legally sufficient if it contains ultimate facts that show a violation has occurred as provided in s. 1012.795 and defined by rule of the State Board of Education. The school shall include all known information relating to the complaint with the filing of the complaint. This paragraph does not limit or restrict the power and duty of the department to investigate complaints, regardless of the school’s untimely filing, or failure to file, complaints and followup reports.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Commissioner of Education shall develop job specifications for investigative personnel employed by the department. Such specifications shall be substantially equivalent to or greater than those job specifications of investigative personnel employed by the Department of Business and Professional Regulation.

However, the complaint and all material assembled during the investigation may be inspected and copied by the certificateholder under investigation, or the certificateholder’s designee, after the investigation is concluded, but prior to the determination of probable cause by the commissioner. If the preliminary investigation is concluded with the finding that there is no probable cause to proceed, the complaint and information shall be open thereafter to inspection pursuant to s. 119.07(1). If the preliminary investigation is concluded with the finding that there is probable cause to proceed and a complaint is filed pursuant to subsection (6), the complaint and information shall be open thereafter to inspection pursuant to s. 119.07(1). If the preliminary investigation ceases to be active, the complaint and all such material shall be open thereafter to inspection pursuant to s. 119.07(1), except as otherwise provided pursuant to s. 1012.798(6). For the purpose of this subsection, a preliminary investigation shall be considered active as long as it is continuing with a reasonable, good faith anticipation that an administrative finding will be made in the foreseeable future.</Text>
