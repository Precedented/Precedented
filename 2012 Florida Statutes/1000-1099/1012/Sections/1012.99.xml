It is the purpose of this agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the states party to it, and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">2. The party states find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from state to state in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other states. As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their states of origin, can increase the available educational resources. Participation in this compact can increase the availability of educational personnel.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">ARTICLE II</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent" SpaceAbove="true">DEFINITIONS</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">As used in this agreement and contracts made pursuant to it, unless the context clearly requires otherwise:</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">1. “Educational personnel” means persons who must meet requirements pursuant to state law as a condition of employment in educational programs.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">2. “Designated state official” means the education official of a state selected by that state to negotiate and enter into, on behalf of this state, contracts pursuant to this agreement.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">3. “Accept,” or any variant thereof, means to recognize and give effect to one or more determinations of another state relating to the qualifications of educational personnel in lieu of making or requiring a like determination that would otherwise be required by or pursuant to the laws of a receiving state.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">4. “State” means a state, territory, or possession of the United States; the district of Columbia; or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">5. “Originating state” means a state and the subdivision thereof, if any, whose determination that certain educational personnel are qualified to be employed for specific duties in schools is acceptable in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">6. “Receiving state” means a state and the subdivisions thereof which accept educational personnel in accordance with the terms of a contract made pursuant to Article III.</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="AlignCenter" SpaceAbove="true">ARTICLE III</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent" SpaceAbove="true">INTERSTATE EDUCATIONAL PERSONNEL CONTRACTS</Text><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Indent">1. The designated state official of a party state may make one or more contracts on behalf of his or her state with one or more other party states providing for the acceptance of educational personnel.
