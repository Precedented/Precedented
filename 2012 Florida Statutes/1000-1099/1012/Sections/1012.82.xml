		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each full-time member of the teaching faculty at any Florida College System institution who is paid wholly from funds appropriated from the Florida College System Program Fund or from funds appropriated for Florida College System institution baccalaureate degree programs shall teach a minimum of 15 classroom contact hours per week at such institution. However, the required classroom contact hours per week may be reduced upon approval of the president of the institution in direct proportion to specific duties and responsibilities assigned the faculty member by his or her departmental chair or other appropriate college administrator. Such specific duties may include specific research duties, specific duties associated with developing television, video tape, or other specifically assigned innovative teaching techniques or devices, or assigned responsibility for off-campus student internship or work-study programs. A “classroom contact hour” consists of a regularly scheduled classroom activity of not less than 50 minutes in a course of instruction which has been approved by the Florida College System institution board of trustees. Any full-time faculty member who is paid partly from Florida College System institution program funds and partly from other funds or appropriations shall teach a minimum number of classroom contact hours per week in such proportion to 15 classroom contact hours as his or her salary paid from Florida College System institution program funds bears to his or her total salary. Any full-time faculty member who is paid partly from funds appropriated for Florida College System institution baccalaureate degree programs and partly from other funds or appropriations shall teach a minimum number of classroom contact hours per week in such proportion to 15 classroom contact hours as his or her salary paid from funds appropriated for Florida College System institution baccalaureate degree programs bears to his or her total salary.</Text>
