In said event the district school board may upon recommendation of the district school superintendent employ, contract with, and compensate for instructional services rendered any person who shall be deemed qualified by regulations of the district school board. In such event, a state certificate to teach shall not be required for such employment, contract, or compensation.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 699, ch. 2002-387.</History></Section>
