		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The Department of Education shall identify the competencies demonstrated by students upon the successful completion of 2 credits of sequential high school foreign language instruction. For the purpose of determining postsecondary equivalence, the department shall develop rules through which Florida College System institutions correlate such competencies to the competencies required of students in the colleges’ respective courses. Based on this correlation, each Florida College System institution shall identify the minimum number of postsecondary credits that students must earn in order to demonstrate a level of competence in a foreign language at least equivalent to that of students who have completed 2 credits of such instruction in high school. The department may also specify alternative means by which students can demonstrate equivalent foreign language competence, including means by which a student whose native language is not English may demonstrate proficiency in the native language. A student who demonstrates proficiency in a native language other than English is exempt from a requirement of completing foreign language courses at the secondary or Florida College System level.</Text>
