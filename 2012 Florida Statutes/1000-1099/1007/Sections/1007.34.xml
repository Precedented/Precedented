Participants should be students who otherwise would be unlikely to seek admission to a Florida College System institution, state university, or independent postsecondary institution without special support and recruitment efforts. The State Board of Education shall adopt rules that provide for the following:</Text>

Institutions that participate must provide on-campus academic and advisory activities during summer vacation and provide opportunities for interacting with college and university students as mentors, tutors, or role models. Proposals submitted by universities and consortia involving universities must provide students with an opportunity to live on campus.</Text>
