The Legislature finds that zero-tolerance policies are not intended to be rigorously applied to petty acts of misconduct and misdemeanors, including, but not limited to, minor fights or disturbances. The Legislature finds that zero-tolerance policies must apply equally to all students regardless of their economic status, race, or disability.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="2"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each district school board shall adopt a policy of zero tolerance that:</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Defines criteria for reporting to a law enforcement agency any act that occurs whenever or wherever students are within the jurisdiction of the district school board.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Defines acts that pose a serious threat to school safety.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="c"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Defines petty acts of misconduct.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="d"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Minimizes the victimization of students, staff, or volunteers, including taking all steps necessary to protect the victim of any violent crime from any further victimization.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="e"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Establishes a procedure that provides each student with the opportunity for a review of the disciplinary action imposed pursuant to s. 1006.07.</Text></Paragraph></Subsection><Subsection Id="3"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Zero-tolerance policies must require students found to have committed one of the following offenses to be expelled, with or without continuing educational services, from the student’s regular school for a period of not less than 1 full year, and to be referred to the criminal justice or juvenile justice system.</Text><Paragraph Id="a"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Bringing a firearm or weapon, as defined in chapter 790, to school, to any school function, or onto any school-sponsored transportation or possessing a firearm at school.</Text></Paragraph><Paragraph Id="b"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Making a threat or false report, as defined by ss. 790.162 and 790.163, respectively, involving school or school personnel’s property, school transportation, or a school-sponsored activity.</Text></Paragraph><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Reversion">District school boards may assign the student to a disciplinary program for the purpose of continuing educational services during the period of expulsion.
