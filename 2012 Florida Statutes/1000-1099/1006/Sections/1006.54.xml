		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The general library of each state university may receive copies of reports of state officials, departments, and institutions and all other state documents published by the state. Each officer of the state empowered by law to distribute such public documents may transmit without charge, except for payment of shipping costs, the number of copies of each public document desired upon requisition from the librarian. It is the duty of the library to keep public documents in a convenient form accessible to the public. The library, under regulations formulated by the university board of trustees, is authorized to exchange documents for those of other states, territories, and countries.</Text>
