			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each Florida College System institution and state university shall strive to reduce its campuswide energy consumption by 10 percent. While savings may be accrued by any means, the goal shall be to implement energy use policies or procedures or both and any equipment retrofits that are necessary to carry out this reduction. The reduction may be obtained by either reducing the cost of the energy consumed or by reducing total energy usage, or a combination of both.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Energy consumption expenditures incurred during the 2007-2008 fiscal year shall be used to establish the benchmark for the 10-percent goal. If a Florida College System institution or state university can document that it has implemented energy use policies or procedures in the 2008-2009 fiscal year or the 2009-2010 fiscal year that resulted in reduction in energy usage or costs, those reductions may be counted towards the 10-percent goal.</Text>

			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Each Florida College System institution and state university shall submit a report to the Governor, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the President of the Senate by January 1, 2011, describing how they have met or plan to meet the 10-percent energy consumption reduction goal.</Text>
