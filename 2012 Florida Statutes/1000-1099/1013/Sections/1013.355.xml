Community development districts are granted the authority to determine, order, levy, impose, collect, and enforce non-ad valorem assessments for such purposes pursuant to this act and chapters 170, 190, and 197. This authority is in addition to any authority granted community development districts under chapter 190. Community development districts are therefore deemed eligible for the financial enhancements available to educational facilities benefit districts providing for financing the construction and maintenance of educational facilities pursuant to s. 1013.356. In order to receive such financial enhancements, a community development district must enter into an interlocal agreement with the district school board and affected local general purpose governments that specifies the obligations of all parties to the agreement. Nothing in this act or in any interlocal agreement entered into pursuant to this act requires any change in the method of election of a board of supervisors of a community development district provided in chapter 190.</Text></Subsection></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 18, ch. 2002-296.</History></Section>
