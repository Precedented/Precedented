			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The first priority for charter school capital outlay funding is to allocate to charter schools that received funding in the 2005-2006 fiscal year an allocation of the same amount per capital outlay full-time equivalent student, up to the lesser of the actual number of capital outlay full-time equivalent students in the current year, or the capital outlay full-time equivalent students in the 2005-2006 fiscal year. After calculating the first priority, the second priority is to allocate excess funds remaining in the appropriation in an amount equal to the per capital outlay full-time equivalent student amount in the first priority calculation to eligible charter schools not included in the first priority calculation and to schools in the first priority calculation with growth greater than the 2005-2006 capital outlay full-time equivalent students. After calculating the first and second priorities, excess funds remaining in the appropriation must be allocated to all eligible charter schools.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="c">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A charter school’s allocation may not exceed one-fifteenth of the cost per student station specified in s. 1013.64(6)(b). Before releasing capital outlay funds to a school district on behalf of the charter school, the Department of Education must ensure that the district school board and the charter school governing board enter into a written agreement that provides for the reversion of any unencumbered funds and all equipment and property purchased with public education funds to the ownership of the district school board, as provided for in subsection (3) if the school terminates operations. Any funds recovered by the state shall be deposited in the General Revenue Fund.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="d">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A charter school is not eligible for a funding allocation if it was created by the conversion of a public school and operates in facilities provided by the charter school’s sponsor for a nominal fee, or at no charge, or if it is directly or indirectly operated by the school district.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="e">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Unless otherwise provided in the General Appropriations Act, the funding allocation for each eligible charter school is determined by multiplying the school’s projected student enrollment by one-fifteenth of the cost-per-student station specified in s. 1013.64(6)(b) for an elementary, middle, or high school, as appropriate. If the funds appropriated are not sufficient, the commissioner shall prorate the available funds among eligible charter schools. However, a charter school or charter lab school may not receive state charter school capital outlay funds greater than the one-fifteenth cost per student station formula if the charter school’s combination of state charter school capital outlay funds, capital outlay funds calculated through the reduction in the administrative fee provided in s. 1002.33(20), and capital outlay funds allowed in s. 1002.32(9)(e) and (h) exceeds the one-fifteenth cost per student station formula.</Text>
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="f">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Funds shall be distributed on the basis of the capital outlay full-time equivalent membership by grade level, which is calculated by averaging the results of the second and third enrollment surveys. The Department of Education shall distribute capital outlay funds monthly, beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year, based on one-twelfth of the amount the department reasonably expects the charter school to receive during that fiscal year. The commissioner shall adjust subsequent distributions as necessary to reflect each charter school’s actual student enrollment as reflected in the second and third enrollment surveys. The commissioner shall establish the intervals and procedures for determining the projected and actual student enrollment of eligible charter schools.</Text>

In the case of a charter lab school, any unencumbered funds and all equipment and property purchased with university public funds shall revert to the ownership of the state university that issued the charter. The reversion of such equipment, property, and furnishings shall focus on recoverable assets, but not on intangible or irrecoverable costs such as rental or leasing fees, normal maintenance, and limited renovations. The reversion of all property secured with public funds is subject to the complete satisfaction of all lawful liens or encumbrances. If there are additional local issues such as the shared use of facilities or partial ownership of facilities or property, these issues shall be agreed to in the charter contract prior to the expenditure of funds.</Text>
