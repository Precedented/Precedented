			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The School Infrastructure Thrift (SIT) Program is established within the Department of Education, and the State Board of Education may adopt rules as necessary to operate the program. To facilitate the program’s purposes, the department shall aggressively seek the elimination or revision of obsolete, excessively restrictive, or unnecessary laws, rules, and regulations for the purpose of reducing the cost of constructing educational facilities and related costs without sacrificing safety or quality of construction. Such efforts must include, but are not limited to, the elimination of duplicate or overlapping inspections; the relaxation of requirements relating to the life cycle of buildings, landscaping, operable glazing, operable windows, radon testing, and firesafety when lawful, safe, and cost-beneficial; and other cost savings identified as lawful, safe, and cost-beneficial.</Text>
