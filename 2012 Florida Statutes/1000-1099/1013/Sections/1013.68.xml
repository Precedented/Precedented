The state covenants with holders of bonds issued under this section that it will not take any action that will materially and adversely affect the rights of such holders so long as such bonds are outstanding. The state does hereby additionally authorize the establishment of a covenant in connection with the bonds which provides that any additional funds received by the state from new or enhanced lottery programs, video gaming, or other similar activities will first be available for payments relating to bonds pledging revenues available pursuant to s. 24.121(2), prior to use for any other purpose.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="5"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A school district may only receive a distribution for use pursuant to paragraph (2)(a) if the district school board certifies to the Commissioner of Education that the district has no unmet need for permanent classroom facilities in its 5-year capital outlay work plan.

If the district does not require its full bonded distribution to eliminate such unmet need, it may bond only that portion of its allocation necessary to meet the needs.</Text></Subsection><Subsection Id="6"><Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">School districts may enter into interlocal agreements to lend their Classrooms First Program funds as provided in paragraph (2)(c).
