		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">For the purpose of implementing jointly financed construction project agreements, or for the construction of combined occupancy structures, any board may purchase, own, convey, sell, lease, or encumber airspace or any other interests in property above the surface of the land, provided the lease of airspace for nonpublic use is for such reasonable rent, length of term, and conditions as the board in its discretion may determine. All proceeds from such sale or lease shall be used by the board or boards receiving the proceeds solely for fixed capital outlay purposes. These purposes may include the renovation or remodeling of existing facilities owned by the board or the construction of new facilities; however, for a Florida College System institution board or university board, such new facility must be authorized by the Legislature. It is declared that the use of such rental by the board for public purposes in accordance with its statutory authority is a public use. Airspace or any other interest in property held by the Board of Trustees of the Internal Improvement Trust Fund or the State Board of Education may not be divested or conveyed without approval of the respective board. Any building, including any building or facility component that is common to both nonpublic and educational portions thereof, constructed in airspace that is sold or leased for nonpublic use pursuant to this section is subject to all applicable state, county, and municipal regulations pertaining to land use, zoning, construction of buildings, fire protection, health, and safety to the same extent and in the same manner as such regulations would be applicable to the construction of a building for nonpublic use on the appurtenant land beneath the subject airspace. Any educational facility constructed or leased as a part of a joint-occupancy facility is subject to all rules and requirements of the respective boards or departments having jurisdiction over educational facilities. Any contract executed by a university board of trustees pursuant to this section is subject to the provisions of s. 1010.62.</Text>
