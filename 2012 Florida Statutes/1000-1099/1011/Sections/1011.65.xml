Conference principals shall include representatives of the Department of Education, the Executive Office of the Governor, and the appropriations committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Conference principals shall discuss and agree to all conventions, including rounding conventions, and methods of computation to be used to calculate Florida Education Finance Program and categorical entitlements of the districts for the fiscal year for which the appropriations are made. These conventions and calculation methods shall remain in effect until further agreements are reached in subsequent allocation conferences called by the commissioner for that purpose. The commissioner shall also, prior to each recalculation of Florida Education Finance Program and categorical allocations of the districts, provide conference principals with all data necessary to replicate those allocations precisely. This data shall include a matrix by district by program of all full-time equivalent changes made by the department as part of its administration of state full-time equivalent caps.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 657, ch. 2002-387.</History></Section>
