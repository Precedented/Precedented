			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph Id="b">
				<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The present state of our knowledge concerning the prevalence, cause or associated factors, and treatment of cancer have resulted primarily from a vast federal investment into basic and clinical research, some of which is expended in this state.

Proven causes of cancer should be publicized and be the subject of educational programs for the prevention of cancer.</Text>
