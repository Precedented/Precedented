The incentives are for internships that are open to students in all disciplines, including business, education, physical science, social science, the liberal arts, and the fine arts. Incentives may be given to any state university. Incentives must be for one semester’s duration, or more, in which an intern may earn up to 12 hours of credit for the internship. Student interns must work in teams to address a specific urban or socially and economically disadvantaged area social problem or carry out an urban or socially and economically disadvantaged area social program. The results of each team’s work must be published in a report and distributed to the colleges of education at each state university.</Text></SectionBody><History xml:space="preserve">s. 212, ch. 2002-387.</History></Section>
