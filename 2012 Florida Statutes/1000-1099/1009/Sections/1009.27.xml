			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">School districts, Florida College System institutions, and state universities may defer tuition and fees for students receiving financial aid from a federal or state assistance program when the aid is delayed in being transmitted to the student through circumstances beyond the control of the student. The failure to make timely application for the aid is an insufficient reason to receive a deferral of fees.</Text>
