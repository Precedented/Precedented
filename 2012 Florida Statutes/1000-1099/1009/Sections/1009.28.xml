		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A student enrolled in the same college-preparatory class more than twice shall pay 100 percent of the full cost of instruction to support continuous enrollment of that student in the same class, and the student shall not be included in calculations of full-time equivalent enrollments for state funding purposes; however, students who withdraw or fail a class due to extenuating circumstances may be granted an exception only once for each class, provided approval is granted according to policy established by the board of trustees. Each Florida College System institution may review and reduce fees paid by students due to continued enrollment in a college-preparatory class on an individual basis contingent upon the student’s financial hardship, pursuant to definitions and fee levels established by the State Board of Education.</Text>
