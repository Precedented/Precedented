			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Student tuition and registration fees at each state university and Florida College System institution shall include up to $4.68 per quarter, or $7.02 per semester, per full-time student, or the per-student credit hour equivalents of such amounts. The fees provided for by this section shall be adjusted from time to time, as necessary, to comply with the debt service coverage requirements of the student loan revenue bonds issued pursuant to s. 1009.79. If the Division of Bond Finance of the State Board of Administration and the Commissioner of Education determine that such fees are no longer required as security for revenue bonds issued pursuant to ss. 1009.78-1009.88, moneys previously collected pursuant to this section which are held in escrow, after administrative expenses have been met and up to $150,000 has been used to establish a financial aid data processing system for the state universities incorporating the necessary features to meet the needs of all 11 universities for application through disbursement processing, shall be reallocated to the generating institutions to be used for student financial aid programs, including, but not limited to, scholarships and grants for educational purposes. Upon such determination, such fees shall no longer be assessed and collected.</Text>
