			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">The First Generation Matching Grant Program is created to enable each state university to provide donors with a matching grant incentive for contributions that will create grant-based student financial aid for undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and whose parents, as defined in s. 1009.21(1), have not earned a baccalaureate degree. In the case of any individual who regularly resided with and received support from only one parent, an individual whose only such parent did not complete a baccalaureate degree would also be eligible.</Text>

		<Subsection Id="2">
			<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">Funds appropriated by the Legislature for the program shall be allocated by the Office of Student Financial Assistance to match private contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Contributions made to a state university and pledged for the purposes of this section are eligible for state matching funds appropriated for this program and are not eligible for any other state matching grant program. Pledged contributions are not eligible for matching prior to the actual collection of the total funds. The Office of Student Financial Assistance shall reserve a proportionate allocation of the total appropriated funds for each state university on the basis of full-time equivalent enrollment. Funds that remain unmatched as of December 1 shall be reallocated to state universities that have remaining unmatched private contributions for the program on the basis of full-time equivalent enrollment.</Text>
