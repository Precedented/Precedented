	<SectionBody>
		<Text xml:space="preserve" Style="Intro">A student enrolled in the same undergraduate college-credit course more than twice shall pay tuition at 100 percent of the full cost of instruction and shall not be included in calculations of full-time equivalent enrollments for state funding purposes. However, students who withdraw or fail a class due to extenuating circumstances may be granted an exception only once for each class, provided that approval is granted according to policy established by the Florida College System institution board of trustees or the university board of trustees. Each Florida College System institution and state university may review and reduce fees paid by students due to continued enrollment in a college-credit class on an individual basis contingent upon the student’s financial hardship. For purposes of this section, first-time enrollment in a class shall mean enrollment in a class beginning fall semester 1997, and calculations of the full cost of instruction shall be based on the systemwide average of the prior year’s cost of undergraduate programs for the Florida College System institutions and the state universities. Boards of trustees may make exceptions to this section for individualized study, elective coursework, courses that are repeated as a requirement of a major, and courses that are intended as continuing over multiple semesters, excluding the repeat of coursework more than two times to increase grade point average or meet minimum course grade requirements.</Text>
